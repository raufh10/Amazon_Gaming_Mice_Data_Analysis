The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed,  they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."}

They are:Gamepad/Controller:  F710 and F310Camera:  C910Headset:  G933Keyboard:  G105Mouse: G502 HeroThe Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151.  The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:1) The mouse2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it.  They are: 2A)  A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer. 2B)  A computer with a URL:  logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO 2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.) 2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.3) A black 6 sided box.When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products.  From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).I decided to contact Logitech support.  First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model.  When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice.  Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list.  The \"Logitech Assistant\" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse.  It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO.  This never ends.  It won't let me talk to an agent until I.  Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant.  (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it.  I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)In the end, I decide to call Logitech.  The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person.  She want to help me. Outstanding!  She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc.  Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:1) The G502-HERO manual.  I've yet to read it.2) The G-Hub manual.3) The G502-HERO downloads.4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset.  It doesn't recognize the mouse.She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.I comply downloading and then starting the installation process.  It wants to restart the system.  OK, I restart the computer.  After logging back into Windows, nothing happens.  The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151.  Ah!  Why did I have to restart?  What was the purpose of the restart.  Nothing looks different, so why the restart?The Logitech support person says to start the installer again.  It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue.  WHAT THE F*******?Honestly:** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations.  Why?  She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it.  This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller.  She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices.  I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling.  (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).)  I use the headset with Discord, games, etc.  I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff.  Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet.  All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse.  I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button.  Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.Bottom line:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people. ***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products). ***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub. ***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?I will update this review should Logitech get back to me.  I'll gladly let you know how it goes.UPDATE 1:  I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues.  The mouse is running in default mode.  I have seen two hardware issues.1)  I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub.  I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great!  It moved and the G was lit.The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen.  The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen.  Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub.  Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs.  I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).Again the bottom line hasn't changed:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.Final update:  Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35!  I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working.  Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105.  The answer is yet another piece of software to run.Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)?  Aren't customers returning worth it?"}
{"asin": "B07GBZ4Q68", "username": "L. Webb", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nOutstanding mouse once you get past the software", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackStyle: Generation 1Pattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software,  There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502.  The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use.  The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software.  (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.)  However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager.  It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for \"ALWAYS ON\" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager.  (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.)  I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to \"ALWAYS ON\".  When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.)  What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked.  Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on.  (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager.  On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me.  And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish.  Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."}

Lowers DPIAnd there are 2 buttons below your mouse scroll.11. The button directly below your mouse scroll is not programmable. Pressing it changes your mouse from normal scroll mode to infinite scroll mode. It's actually really satisfying to spin the wheel in infinite scroll mode, but I haven't had a good reason to use it yet. I'm sure one exists though, and I can't deny it's fun to use.12. Change profiles (You can create a custom profile so each programmable button does different things!)It takes some time to get used to using the mouse. I originally thought the mouse would be quite bulky for some reason. It most certainly is not and holds comfortably. One thing I dislike is that I press the buttons on the edge of the left mouse click button quite frequently by accident, and it can get frustrating. It's been a couple weeks now, and I still press it on occasion.The mouse also comes with weights that you can insert into it to weigh it down if you want to. It seems kind of gimmicky to me since I never pick my mouse up while using it, but I guess some people would be sensitive to it.You need to download Logitech G HUB to program the buttons and change the lighting effects on the mouse. Yes, you can create and set a macro to any programmable button. If you wanted to, you can also save those settings onto the mouse's on-board memory (which I recommend), and then you don't need to have the app active anymore. In fact, you could even delete it off your computer if you wanted to."}

You get a lot for $40 except in one key area and its a doosy.The switches for the buttons are cheap, they fail with heavy use hence why I am on my third. I am going to attempt to replace the switches on the old mice with braided cables.Is this worth $40-45 for gaming? Yes, but the cheap thin cord gives the mouse a cheap look and dont be surprised in a year or so of heavy gaming you develop problems with the buttons.Its a great mouse design wise but over the years its quality keeps creeping down.

I searched for a long time trying a bunch of different mice and reading a lot of reviews. I heard a lot of things about the G502 and the main Problem was double clicking not only with Logitech but the corsair m65  that I also looked at. So to avoid that I went to razer specifically a razer viper 8k. Unfortunately that did not fit the bill and I ended up Returning it. Then I found this version of the G502! It has optical switches! So no double clicking! I could gush about all the things that this mouse does right but it would probably be quicker to tell you my pet peeves with this mouse. The only things I can say about this mouse are as follows, for a premium mouse not having a braded cable is a major undersight! Logitech should release a revamp of this model. I expect a braded cable for a premium mouse! Next gevence I have Is a bit of a small problem that could easily be fixed. It needs the 3 leds from the G502 to indicate profile and dip. Not being able to color code my dpi modes is a real boon. Thoughts are my only Problems with this mouse. No braided cable and a more quality of life improvement for the leds to indicate what profile your using especially when your just running the mouse on the internal memory. Other than thoughts 2 things this mouse is awemazing! I dont know why you would go with the old G502 that is prone to double clicking! If you were an avid user of the G9X back in the day then I can highly recommend this mouse full heartedly! 4/5 StarsPros: Great Ergonomics for all hands and GripsMouse clicks are responsive and snappy and satisfyingthe removable dip switch is a nice touch even thought I dont really use it.the G buttons next to the left click are awesome to change the dpi (a definite improvement from the G9X)thumb buttons are easy to press and are very responsive and feel fantastic.the Rubber texture for the grip is just the right of amount of grip texture and soft rubber.Scroll wheel can free spin and feels great to click!Cons: No braided cable! What the HECK! Logitech this is a premium mouse! Razer and corsair both use them and for good reason! I am always an advocate for braided cables anything!The dpi Light could be in a better spot and there could be more than 1 led to indicate dpit, at least let you set a color for specific profiles so when you switch to a different one you know what profile your using especially when your using the on board memory."}

My old G604, which never suffered from the infamous \"double-click\", was getting long in the tooth - the rubber was peeling off at the thumb rest. Saw this G604X on sale and asked, \"why not?\"I was worried about going back to a wired mouse after enjoying the convenience of a very responsive wireless connection, so my expectations were pretty low to begin with. I'm so glad I got this wired G502 X mouse. The first thing I felt was how much lighter it was, how the feet slid so much better, and probably most of all, the scroll wheel and thumb buttons were so smooth that it didn't move the mouse at all.I don't really miss moving from 15 buttons on the G604 to the 13 on this G502. From a realistic productivity point of view, if one button was used as a G-Shift button, that equates to 25 on the G604 and 23 on the G502 (I don't use a Logitech keyboard for that G-Shift key).From now on, the G604 goes in my bag for those occasions where I don't work from home, but this G502X stays at home an attached to my primary home office/battle station."}

They are:Gamepad/Controller:  F710 and F310Camera:  C910Headset:  G933Keyboard:  G105Mouse: G502 HeroThe Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151.  The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:1) The mouse2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it.  They are: 2A)  A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer. 2B)  A computer with a URL:  logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO 2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.) 2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.3) A black 6 sided box.When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products.  From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).I decided to contact Logitech support.  First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model.  When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice.  Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list.  The \"Logitech Assistant\" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse.  It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO.  This never ends.  It won't let me talk to an agent until I.  Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant.  (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it.  I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)In the end, I decide to call Logitech.  The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person.  She want to help me. Outstanding!  She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc.  Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:1) The G502-HERO manual.  I've yet to read it.2) The G-Hub manual.3) The G502-HERO downloads.4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset.  It doesn't recognize the mouse.She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.I comply downloading and then starting the installation process.  It wants to restart the system.  OK, I restart the computer.  After logging back into Windows, nothing happens.  The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151.  Ah!  Why did I have to restart?  What was the purpose of the restart.  Nothing looks different, so why the restart?The Logitech support person says to start the installer again.  It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue.  WHAT THE F*******?Honestly:** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations.  Why?  She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it.  This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller.  She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices.  I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling.  (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).)  I use the headset with Discord, games, etc.  I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff.  Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet.  All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse.  I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button.  Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.Bottom line:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people. ***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products). ***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub. ***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?I will update this review should Logitech get back to me.  I'll gladly let you know how it goes.UPDATE 1:  I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues.  The mouse is running in default mode.  I have seen two hardware issues.1)  I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub.  I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great!  It moved and the G was lit.The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen.  The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen.  Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub.  Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs.  I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).Again the bottom line hasn't changed:  The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.Final update:  Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35!  I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working.  Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105.  The answer is yet another piece of software to run.Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)?  Aren't customers returning worth it?"}

The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use.  The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software.  (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.)  However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager.  It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for \"ALWAYS ON\" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager.  (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.)  I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to \"ALWAYS ON\".  When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.)  What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked.  Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on.  (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager.  On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me.  And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish.  Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."}

Pressing it changes your mouse from normal scroll mode to infinite scroll mode. It's actually really satisfying to spin the wheel in infinite scroll mode, but I haven't had a good reason to use it yet. I'm sure one exists though, and I can't deny it's fun to use.12. Change profiles (You can create a custom profile so each programmable button does different things!)It takes some time to get used to using the mouse. I originally thought the mouse would be quite bulky for some reason. It most certainly is not and holds comfortably. One thing I dislike is that I press the buttons on the edge of the left mouse click button quite frequently by accident, and it can get frustrating. It's been a couple weeks now, and I still press it on occasion.The mouse also comes with weights that you can insert into it to weigh it down if you want to. It seems kind of gimmicky to me since I never pick my mouse up while using it, but I guess some people would be sensitive to it.You need to download Logitech G HUB to program the buttons and change the lighting effects on the mouse. Yes, you can create and set a macro to any programmable button. If you wanted to, you can also save those settings onto the mouse's on-board memory (which I recommend), and then you don't need to have the app active anymore. In fact, you could even delete it off your computer if you wanted to."}

You get a lot for $40 except in one key area and its a doosy.The switches for the buttons are cheap, they fail with heavy use hence why I am on my third. I am going to attempt to replace the switches on the old mice with braided cables.Is this worth $40-45 for gaming? Yes, but the cheap thin cord gives the mouse a cheap look and dont be surprised in a year or so of heavy gaming you develop problems with the buttons.Its a great mouse design wise but over the years its quality keeps creeping down.

I searched for a long time trying a bunch of different mice and reading a lot of reviews. I heard a lot of things about the G502 and the main Problem was double clicking not only with Logitech but the corsair m65  that I also looked at. So to avoid that I went to razer specifically a razer viper 8k. Unfortunately that did not fit the bill and I ended up Returning it. Then I found this version of the G502! It has optical switches! So no double clicking! I could gush about all the things that this mouse does right but it would probably be quicker to tell you my pet peeves with this mouse. The only things I can say about this mouse are as follows, for a premium mouse not having a braded cable is a major undersight! Logitech should release a revamp of this model. I expect a braded cable for a premium mouse! Next gevence I have Is a bit of a small problem that could easily be fixed. It needs the 3 leds from the G502 to indicate profile and dip. Not being able to color code my dpi modes is a real boon. Thoughts are my only Problems with this mouse. No braided cable and a more quality of life improvement for the leds to indicate what profile your using especially when your just running the mouse on the internal memory. Other than thoughts 2 things this mouse is awemazing! I dont know why you would go with the old G502 that is prone to double clicking! If you were an avid user of the G9X back in the day then I can highly recommend this mouse full heartedly! 4/5 StarsPros: Great Ergonomics for all hands and GripsMouse clicks are responsive and snappy and satisfyingthe removable dip switch is a nice touch even thought I dont really use it.the G buttons next to the left click are awesome to change the dpi (a definite improvement from the G9X)thumb buttons are easy to press and are very responsive and feel fantastic.the Rubber texture for the grip is just the right of amount of grip texture and soft rubber.Scroll wheel can free spin and feels great to click!Cons: No braided cable! What the HECK! Logitech this is a premium mouse! Razer and corsair both use them and for good reason! I am always an advocate for braided cables anything!The dpi Light could be in a better spot and there could be more than 1 led to indicate dpit, at least let you set a color for specific profiles so when you switch to a different one you know what profile your using especially when your using the on board memory."}

My old G604, which never suffered from the infamous \"double-click\", was getting long in the tooth - the rubber was peeling off at the thumb rest. Saw this G604X on sale and asked, \"why not?\"I was worried about going back to a wired mouse after enjoying the convenience of a very responsive wireless connection, so my expectations were pretty low to begin with. I'm so glad I got this wired G502 X mouse. The first thing I felt was how much lighter it was, how the feet slid so much better, and probably most of all, the scroll wheel and thumb buttons were so smooth that it didn't move the mouse at all.I don't really miss moving from 15 buttons on the G604 to the 13 on this G502. From a realistic productivity point of view, if one button was used as a G-Shift button, that equates to 25 on the G604 and 23 on the G502 (I don't use a Logitech keyboard for that G-Shift key).From now on, the G604 goes in my bag for those occasions where I don't work from home, but this G502X stays at home an attached to my primary home office/battle station."}

{"asin": "B07GBZ4Q68", "username": "Subnet", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest mouse hands down!", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021", "purchased": "Color: BlackStyle: Generation 1Pattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!1) Daily useNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros: - Fits incredibly well around your hand - Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use  > Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc. - Great grip - Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software2) GamingWhen I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros: - You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better! - The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something) - The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!*** Update ***The mouse is durable  and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."}

The mouse suddenly lags and stops working for a few seconds at random intervals throughout the day. Sometimes it does not happen and it's the most minor issue out of everything.2. The dpi suddenly changes without me touching anything at random times during the day. This is not a misclick as I even tried disabling the dpi up and dpi down button in the mouse, even the profile switched so that it won't suddenly change but it still changes. This is especially true when you leave the pc on for a long period of time and you'll come back to the mouse with a different dpi.3. The onboard memory does not work, I settings do not change sometimes when trying to load profiles from the Logitech Hub app. This can be frustrating as you will need to try and load the settings again into the mouse but it eventually works.4. The left click mouse sometimes fails? I don't even know how to describe it but dragging and dropping things sometimes feels clonky but at times works, left click sometimes clicks twice even when not intended but both of these things I can't pinpoint if it's the mouse or just a me problem. Internet says these G502 are prone to failing switches so I am not going to risk it with this mouse.A lot of minor things here and there and nothing that can't be fixed or worked around with a short google search but it's not for me as I am deeply bothered by the minor bugs and issues that it brings.All of the issues above and the other issues I am experiencing are widely known in google so I suggest that you research the issues of the G502 first before buying this mouse as almost all of the posted problems will appear and is happening sooner or later."}

The best feature is really that you can adjust the scroll wheel tension to either be free-spinning or in increments. Also, I found that even though I have somewhat smaller hands than the average person, this mouse is still very comfortable.The Good: This mouse also has some weights that can be added to the bottom. I just put all the weights in the mouse partly to avoid losing the weights, and partly because it does make the mouse have a nice weight. Also, because it is wired, it never runs out of battery!The (subjectively) bad: It has a few RGB lights on it (RGB fans rejoice). I found it defaults to running through the rainbow, and that can be a little annoying. If you hate RGB or want a static color, you have to get the Logitech app (G-Hub or something) to change the RGB settings.The Bad: The most annoying thing about this mouse is actually that you can change the DPI (dots per inch) with the two buttons right next to your index finger. I have run this mouse into my keyboard and inadvertently changed the DPI so many times with this mouse that I've taken to just changing the DPI settings to be effectively all the same.TL:DR: Nice mouse with some RGB lights that provides an enjoyable user experience, with one quirk."}

If the X started out as its current weight and had the Hero's weight adjustment feature it would feel like an appropriate upgrade, but that's not the case.The Hero has RGB lighting which is a relatively low priority \"want\", but it's nice if you use multiple profiles while the X doesn't have any lights other than the DPI meter by the mouse wheel, which is seemingly bugged anyway and does not change regardless of which DPI setting I have selected, so it's basically useless.All around, the supposedly \"new generation\" G502 X feels like a downgrade to the Hero, despite the price difference going in the opposite direction. The X doesn't even have a braided cable, which feels ridiculously cheap for a $70 mouse compared to the Hero which does have the braided cable.I have used Logitech peripherals for years and I'm generally quite happy every time I upgrade to a new version of something (I've owned 3 iterations of the G Pro headset over the past 5 years and every one has improved on the previous model), but this time it's a solid miss. I'll be saving my extra $30 and returning this and rebuying the Hero."}

The 650L is also great as it has better ergonomics than other Logitech mice, has Bluetooth, has silent clicks, and the semi - free - scrolling wheel is great.the m705 is another recommendable choice. It's extremely comfortable and has the free scrolling ability (though without the magspeed). the main drawback with this mouse is that the pads on the bottom are rough compared to other mice so it doesn't glide as smoothly.the mx anywhere 3 is an interesting choice as it has the magspeed wheel and while it doesn't provide support for your hand it's not so small as to be painful to use for long periods, but it was the most expensive mouse I tried by a big margin, and the price doesn't seem justified.I think it's important to point out that the number of features a product offers is not as important as the usefulness of each feature to the individual consumer. E.g. The 650L has fewer features than some of the other models but I would still strongly recommend it for its practical day-to-day usability. features that i cared about in order of their usefulness are as follows (grouped into 3 tiers)Features that mattered most to me:magspeed wheel (automatically switches between ratcheted and free scrolling)basic free scrolling wheelsemi-free scrolling wheel (m650L)Smoothness of glidingFeatures that I liked but don't use oftenbluetooth wirelessnumber of programmable buttonsbluetooth connection memory for up to 3 computers.features i didn't really care about or that made no observable difference:high dpi supportrechargeability"}

So far it's been working wonderfully, and it does have an incredibly slim profile, much smaller than any others I have seen (just a tad above 1/2\" tall). When you plug it in, there is no driver installation prompt, so it is strictly just a USB powered device, and doesn't look funky under hardware settings. I have a rather larger vertical mouse, and it seems to be working perfectly so far with no issues, I haven't had any problems with it picking up the rotation, but I have seen that some people have solved this with a bit of tape or sharpie on the rotator itself. Again, I haven't had that problem, but just for knowledge. What's really neat about this as well outside of the very low profile design, is the fact that you do have an easy on and off switch, and it cycles through different modes depending on when you want the mouse to move, or even how long the mouse will move in random intervals between 1 and 60 seconds for unpredictability. Naturally it is obviously going to move the mouse in only two directions, but for keeping your screen awake and active, this is definitely fantastic, stealthy, and I like it a lot.

So far it's been working wonderfully, and it does have an incredibly slim profile, much smaller than any others I have seen (just a tad above 1/2\" tall). When you plug it in, there is no driver installation prompt, so it is strictly just a USB powered device, and doesn't look funky under hardware settings. I have a rather larger vertical mouse, and it seems to be working perfectly so far with no issues, I haven't had any problems with it picking up the rotation, but I have seen that some people have solved this with a bit of tape or sharpie on the rotator itself. Again, I haven't had that problem, but just for knowledge. What's really neat about this as well outside of the very low profile design, is the fact that you do have an easy on and off switch, and it cycles through different modes depending on when you want the mouse to move, or even how long the mouse will move in random intervals between 1 and 60 seconds for unpredictability. Naturally it is obviously going to move the mouse in only two directions, but for keeping your screen awake and active, this is definitely fantastic, stealthy, and I like it a lot. Highly recommended!"}

A shorter duration might have worked for me, but this is not adjustable for movement.I have a usb fob jiggler that moves the cursor such a small amount it doesn’t interfere like this does- that works better for me.

I restarted my PC and unplugged and replugged it in, and it fixed. However, I believe this was coincidental. On the 10th, the right click started acting HORRENDOUS. As in, triple clicking, clicking when not pressing, dropping clicks entirely... Restarting and replugging it did not change a thing. Tested on another PC, same issue. Swapped out cable extenders, same issue. Attempted plugging it directly into the PC, as inconvenient as that would be in my setup... still the issue. Multiple ports, no help.I firmly believe stuff happens. Quality control is not, and never will be perfect. I ended up reordering this mouse off Wal-Mart to see. So far it is working flawless. The mouse is incredible, I think I got unlucky here... again. I also ordered an EVGA X20 off Amazon. Hope it goes better, too. I still think overall I would recommend this product, as it wouldn't have such a high rating so consistently if this happened incredibly often. I will dock a few starts, but I honestly still think the mouse it good.X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-XOriginal post -I first ordered a Redragon M910K, and it was faulty. I decided to put 10 extra dollars in and order this mouse instead.  Take note this is a day one review and if I have problems, I will update. Assume this is all still relevant if you see this review after a couple months and I haven't edited it.  First Impressions  -Glide is good. Feels very smooth.  -Cable pulls the mouse slightly due to the smooth glide. However, not much, and if your cable is tied forward, or simply going straight, you won't notice it. Just don't have your cable go off at an angle immediately and you need not to worry.  -Feels very... non-durable? I wouldn't slam it. If you aren't a heavy rager, it should be fine. Hit your keyboard instead. NOT CHEAP FEELING THOUGH. Feels perfectly fine for this price!  -Simple look. Black with Green LED's. Perfect printing on the logo.  -Side buttons are a bit high for me, if your thumb rests low like mine, you may have a hard time reaching them. That's why the \"Ergonomic\" is a 4 star, but only from a personal stance not an overall stance.  -Very Comfortable. Enough said  Overall, I am very happy with this, and if this review is un-updated, I still am. Just waiting for the software to install to change my DPI currently. If you are looking for a good mouse below $30, this is a good mouse. A very good mouse.  Would I recommend it at this price range? Yes.  Best regards from a fat idiot"}

I restarted my PC and unplugged and replugged it in, and it fixed. However, I believe this was coincidental. On the 10th, the right click started acting HORRENDOUS. As in, triple clicking, clicking when not pressing, dropping clicks entirely... Restarting and replugging it did not change a thing. Tested on another PC, same issue. Swapped out cable extenders, same issue. Attempted plugging it directly into the PC, as inconvenient as that would be in my setup... still the issue. Multiple ports, no help.I firmly believe stuff happens. Quality control is not, and never will be perfect. I ended up reordering this mouse off Wal-Mart to see. So far it is working flawless. The mouse is incredible, I think I got unlucky here... again. I also ordered an EVGA X20 off Amazon. Hope it goes better, too. I still think overall I would recommend this product, as it wouldn't have such a high rating so consistently if this happened incredibly often. I will dock a few starts, but I honestly still think the mouse it good.X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-XOriginal post -I first ordered a Redragon M910K, and it was faulty. I decided to put 10 extra dollars in and order this mouse instead.  Take note this is a day one review and if I have problems, I will update. Assume this is all still relevant if you see this review after a couple months and I haven't edited it.  First Impressions  -Glide is good. Feels very smooth.  -Cable pulls the mouse slightly due to the smooth glide. However, not much, and if your cable is tied forward, or simply going straight, you won't notice it. Just don't have your cable go off at an angle immediately and you need not to worry.  -Feels very... non-durable? I wouldn't slam it. If you aren't a heavy rager, it should be fine. Hit your keyboard instead. NOT CHEAP FEELING THOUGH. Feels perfectly fine for this price!  -Simple look. Black with Green LED's. Perfect printing on the logo.  -Side buttons are a bit high for me, if your thumb rests low like mine, you may have a hard time reaching them. That's why the \"Ergonomic\" is a 4 star, but only from a personal stance not an overall stance.  -Very Comfortable. Enough said  Overall, I am very happy with this, and if this review is un-updated, I still am. Just waiting for the software to install to change my DPI currently. If you are looking for a good mouse below $30, this is a good mouse. A very good mouse.  Would I recommend it at this price range? Yes.  Best regards from a fat idiot"}

{"asin": "B07CMS5Q6P", "username": "Petre I.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nLogitech G306", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2019", "purchased": "Color: WhitePattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I have been using a G Pro wired for the last 3 years followed by both a black and a white G305 on a desktop and a laptop for the last year. This review is about what I’d like to see in an updated version of the G305 mouse. I really hope that there will be an update because despite various points I will discuss below, it is the best mouse that I have used both in terms of performance and shape. The devil is in the details, and since most of the good design considerations that lead to better mice for us, the consumers are now well established and understood it is more important than ever to really pay attention to the details.1. Sensor: Bad sensors in gaming mice have become a thing of the past. Sadly this is not true for mice in general, but hopefully soon the “non-gaming” mice will catch on. More on this below. It is important to remember that laser sensors at one point almost took over. Market pressures and advertising every so often can lead to bad decisions.2. Connection: With the introduction of G305, wireless has become a viable option. I use my G305 with an AA to AAA adapter and a rechargeable AAA battery to reduce weight. My estimation is that I get about 400 hours on a fully charged AAA battery having set the mouse on HI Performance, 1000Hz. This is more than enough, and I think a very good option for both desktop and laptop use, having the ability to easily change rechargeable batteries a few times a year. This is an important accomplishment in the world of computer mice in general, as it should put more pressure on non-gaming mice and their sensors, which currently it hasn’t. Another great option introduced by Logitech is the charging pad, especially for a desktop. A battery whether integrated or replaceable will always add some weight compared to a wired mouse, but having no cable (no matter how flexible) has its own advantages. In order to reduce even more weight what I would really like to see in the future is the use of one AAA battery instead of AA (an adapter has its own weight) and rechargeable mice with a POWERCORE module integrated into the body, rather than requiring an add-on piece. A further reduction in weight might be possible by even removing the charging port, so it would be strictly designed for the recharging pad.3. Weight: G305 is light in weight, especially with an AAA battery, just under 90g, but it can be even lighter with a more aggressive design. Of course punched holes in the shell are not necessary and even not ideal as stronger and lighter thin shell is possible with a well designed construction. Although it is a marketing strategy, it reveals that consumers are not scared of seeing electronic components. It might be a useful thing to keep in mind when designing mice with replaceable batteries in order to reduce unneeded plastic used around battery compartments.4. Shape: I am a fingertip grip user. My hand is slightly over 7 inches from the end of my wrist to the tip of my middle finger. I probably have smaller than average hand for a guy, but likely about average overall. I really like the shape and size of G305 as well as the placement of its buttons and the texture of the plastic. It is not perfect, but it comes the closest compared to many gaming mice I’ve tried or used over the years. I do think that there is a small room for improvement, which I am showing in the image that I have included, but any changes made to the shape need to be handled with restraint. The only two areas of improvement that I see is making the mouse slightly wider with more ergonomic curves designed for right hand use only (with a separate left hand version).5. Buttons: I really like the number of buttons on G305 as well as their placement and mechanism. The mechanism for the two main buttons in particular is a great design which has been used by many of the top Logitech mice for years now, but it does lower the tension which makes the buttons too sensitive. My favorite buttons on a mouse were from Logitech G9x, and although great I wish the main buttons on G305 had the same mechanism as the ones on G9x. Additionally, there is a flaw and an obvious overlook during quality control in the design of G305’s two side buttons. The small PCB onto which the side switches are mounted is either thinner than originally intended, or ended up not quite in the right place, allowing a small gap between the plunger of the switches and the plastic buttons, making it necessary to press the buttons much deeper than they need to be in order to actuate the switches. I was able to fix the issue, but not without opening the mouse.6. Switches: This is an area that is long overdue for an overhaul. I’m not sure which company first started the trend many years ago of publishing the durability of their switches in number of clicks (10, 20, 30, 40 million), but sadly we have all fallen into a trap set by marketing pressures. Omron, the company that manufactures the switches do sell retail Omron switches with a branding on them Omron Japan, but not rated for this high number of clicks. Apparently some time ago mouse manufacturers decided to start using non-retail switches from Omron, likely at lower prices, which they then tested in-house and assigned the 20 million clicks that their marketing department made us think we need to have in our mice. The only problem being is that those non-retail switches are actually more often than not lower quality than their retail versions and the 20 million clicks rating being absolutely meaningless as it doesn’t represent real life variable pressure usage over time. When once the buttons of a regular mouse that came with an old PC might last for 10 years now might only last a few months before a “20 million” switch starts to misbehave. In case somebody is wondering, Omron D2F-01F for the primary buttons and Omron D2F-01 for the secondary buttons is what we need to have back in our mice. The F version has about half the actuation force, which is great for instant response and effortless repeated clicks, while the other version gives better tactility.7. Scroll wheel: It seems that for the most part a good design has become a standard among gaming mice. This means no side tilt, no free-spin, and step scrolling with just the right amount of force and feedback. Before buying G Pro I used G303 for about a year and a half. I can see a very clear evolution in the mechanism and encoders being used between G303, G Pro wired and G305. G303 had a fantastic scroll wheel with the only flaw being prone to debris interfering with the encoder sensor. G Pro wired used an encoder that becomes too loose, while G305 is pretty much perfect. There is room for improvement, however. The rubber ridges on the wheel of the G305 are unnecessarily small and pronounced, feeling unpleasantly sharp. The rubber texture of the G903 is a good example of a perfect rubber ring for a scroll wheel. The other area that can be improved is the middle button, and more specifically its switch. The mechanism of the wheel in G305 looks great and will likely allow the middle button to actuate with the same amount of force and give the same feedback as the other secondary buttons, but the switch needs to be Omron D2F-01. Currently the small switch that’s used is fine, but there are mice with Omron sized switches in the middle button and it is definitely an improvement.8. Software: G HUB needs refinement. This has always been a strong point for Logitech, and their software continues to be great both in terms of functionality and stability, but their new interface needs to be simplified for ease of use.9. Feet: The original feet are fine, but I didn’t use the mouse with them very long as I had to remove them in order to open the mouse to fix or change some of the parts as discussed above. Unfortunately Logitech still does not sell spare mouse feet for this mouse. This might be due to the fact that for some reason they decided to make one of them very small and with a different thickness than the other four mouse feet. Can we please have all mouse feet the same thickness, not have too many and too small, and not have them cover the screw holes?This would have to be it for now. As always don’t forget to disable “Enhance pointer precision” in Windows mouse settings, and in the unlikely event that somebody from Microsoft reads this, if possible, please kindly make it disabled by default, or better yet, remove the option completely. Thank you very much, and we’ll be grateful for years to come."}

This mouse deserves every bit of its 5-star rating for several compelling reasons, though it's not without a few minor quibbles.Pros:1. Speedy Wireless Connectivity: The Logitech G305's wireless performance is impressive, offering responsiveness that rivals wired mice. It's perfect for fast-paced gaming, and I haven't experienced any noticeable lag. However, its wireless range could be improved, so be mindful of that.2. Sharp and Tactile Clicks: The mouse clicks are a standout feature for me. They're sharp, tactile, and provide a satisfying feedback that's crucial for precision in gaming. It's a pleasure to use for both gaming and everyday tasks.3. Comfortable Ergonomics: The G305's ergonomic design suits a claw grip style, which I personally prefer. It fits comfortably in hand, allowing for long gaming sessions without discomfort.4. Lightning-Fast Sensor: The sensor speed on this mouse is fantastic. It's incredibly accurate and responsive, ensuring your every movement is translated flawlessly on-screen. This is a significant advantage for gamers who demand precision.5. Good Battery Life: While it's not the best among wireless mice with swappable batteries, the G305's battery life is still respectable. It keeps you gaming for hours before needing a battery change.Cons:1. Non-Rechargeable: One notable drawback is that the G305 relies on swappable batteries instead of being rechargeable. While this allows for uninterrupted gaming by swapping batteries, it can be a hassle to source and replace them.2. Limited Software Customization: The Logitech G-Hub software, while functional, leaves something to be desired in terms of customization options. I wish it offered more advanced features to truly unlock the mouse's potential.3. Easily Pressed Side Buttons: The side buttons, while of good quality, are somewhat prone to accidental presses due to their placement. This may be a minor inconvenience for some users.4. Prone to Dirt: The white variant of the G305 is a stunner, but it does attract dirt and smudges relatively easily. Regular cleaning is needed to keep it looking pristine.Overall, at a price point of $35, the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in white is an exceptional buy. Its swift wireless connectivity, tactile clicks, comfortable design for claw grip users, and blazing sensor speed make it a top-notch gaming mouse. While rechargeability and more comprehensive software features would be nice additions, they don't detract significantly from the overall value. If you're looking for a budget-friendly yet high-performance gaming mouse, the G305 is an excellent choice that won't disappoint."}

I always used brands like Razer.  The main issue I always seemed to have with the gaming brands, though, was that they were VERY hyper sensitive.  They felt great and did well for gaming, but everyday tasks became a pain.  Since I've had such great luck with Logitech in the past with their keyboards, I decided to see if they made gaming mice.  Turns out they do!  Did a bit of research, and this particular model seemed to be the best one that fit my casual gamer mold.It does come with a battery, so MAJOR hats off to Logitech for that alone.  However, when I first started using it, there was a TON of lag.  Like nothing I had ever experienced before in a mouse.  Turns out, it was the mouse sensitivity.  And unlike most mice, you can change it on the fly on the ACTUAL device!  The small button in the middle will auto-adjust the sensitivity without needing to access any software.  I've NEVER had a mouse before the could do that.  Even the triple digit mice I've purchased in the past couldn't do that.  A few clicks and I was able to get the sensitivity I needed.The software you can optionally download is a nice bonus as it allows you to map the buttons and even has custom default settings for popular games like World of Warcraft (my personal favorite).Verdict?  For someone who uses their mouse for mainly practical things but also likes to game on the side, I feel like this is the PERFECT device for you.  Other mice have a full blown number pad on them with customizable lighting.  If you're a hardcore gamer, maybe look for one of those, but having used some of them in the past, this mouse has been far more reliable in terms of functionality, which I personally prefer over bling.  It does what it needs to do, and that's exactly what I needed.  Five stars!"}

{"asin": "B07CMS5Q6P", "username": "Christopher Davies", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nMaybe best price/performance on market", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackPattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I rated 5/5 because I think what you get for the money is good, not because it's perfect (at the time of writing I paid $30 including shipping). I'm going to rate the aspects important to me in a mouse on a scale of 10 and give a brief description why, as someone who games competitively.Shape/Form: 9/10Medium-size form factor. Nothing innovative here but it doesn't have to be. It's comfortable to use and cups in the palm nicely.Weight: 8/10I'm still not sure if there's a point where a mouse can be TOO light. I personally haven't found that point yet. I've used lighter mice than this and didn't notice much of a difference. I don't feel any extra fatigue using this one. Make no mistake though, this is a light mouse.Buttons: 9/10It's not loaded with a bunch of extra buttons and I like that. Buttons are what a keyboard is for, not a mouse. That said it has robust mapping options in the software for the buttons it does have. I don't do any special mappings but it's nice the option's there. I had to dock a point for the left and right click. I find the pressure threshold for clicking is TOO sensitive, to the point the mere gravity of my finger resting on the buttons engages a click. This resulted in me needing to permanently flex back my index and ring fingers so they wouldn't trigger clicks. As a result I had to fold up a little piece of paper and slide it under the corners of the buttons to increase the pressure.. This was an easy hack so it doesn't really bother me. It would be nice to have some mechanism to adjust click pressure in future models though.Wireless: 8/10The reception is good, it feels about as responsive as a wired mouse. I'll only very occasionally get some response stalling for a 1/4 cm of movement of the mouse before it registers. And this only seems to happen if the cursor sits in the same position for a prolonged period of time. You also have to use a special dongle. It's not the end of the world and I understand it's for better performance, but it takes up another slot in your usb real estate and it would be nicer if I could use 1 dongle for all my peripherals instead of 2.DPI: 8/10This thing advertises 12K DPI and I bought it as a replacement for their 1K DPI standard logi mouse I got for $20. I have no way to test this but it doesn't feel 12x faster. At max settings it feels 2x faster or AT MOST 3x. Now it could be some of this dpi is being used for smoother transitions between points of movement and it does feel smoother and less choppy than the $20 logi. It's max speed setting is pretty good though. It's hard to imagine you'd want much faster than this. It could still be smoother though and if it is indeed 12K dpi as advertised then I could imagine even higher dpi's could be beneficial for the most elite levels of gaming. I think I'd prefere just a touch more sensitivity myself but this is very usable for competitive gaming and I think this would meet the demands of 99.9% of gamers.Closing Thoughts:Good mouse for the money. In the consumer electronics space in general I'd like to see some independent labs open up to test these electronics and confirm their claims of performance. I think logitech is a reputable company and I'm inclined to trust this mouse wields 12K dpi, but how could I ever confirm this? The residential electronics market has already solved this with the common UL (UnderwriterLabs) symbol marking system. This is a seal of quality and an independent confirmation of performance by an independent lab. This ensures reliable performance and protects the consumer against fraud. The current system we have for consumer electronics of relying on reviewers to write (potentially compromised) sponsored reviews is inadequate at this point. There are too many devices out there and the research expected of a single consumer to sift through this endless catalog is far too much."}

{"asin": "B07CMS5Q6P", "username": "Petre I.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nLogitech G306", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2019", "purchased": "Color: WhitePattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I have been using a G Pro wired for the last 3 years followed by both a black and a white G305 on a desktop and a laptop for the last year. This review is about what I’d like to see in an updated version of the G305 mouse. I really hope that there will be an update because despite various points I will discuss below, it is the best mouse that I have used both in terms of performance and shape. The devil is in the details, and since most of the good design considerations that lead to better mice for us, the consumers are now well established and understood it is more important than ever to really pay attention to the details.1. Sensor: Bad sensors in gaming mice have become a thing of the past. Sadly this is not true for mice in general, but hopefully soon the “non-gaming” mice will catch on. More on this below. It is important to remember that laser sensors at one point almost took over. Market pressures and advertising every so often can lead to bad decisions.2. Connection: With the introduction of G305, wireless has become a viable option. I use my G305 with an AA to AAA adapter and a rechargeable AAA battery to reduce weight. My estimation is that I get about 400 hours on a fully charged AAA battery having set the mouse on HI Performance, 1000Hz. This is more than enough, and I think a very good option for both desktop and laptop use, having the ability to easily change rechargeable batteries a few times a year. This is an important accomplishment in the world of computer mice in general, as it should put more pressure on non-gaming mice and their sensors, which currently it hasn’t. Another great option introduced by Logitech is the charging pad, especially for a desktop. A battery whether integrated or replaceable will always add some weight compared to a wired mouse, but having no cable (no matter how flexible) has its own advantages. In order to reduce even more weight what I would really like to see in the future is the use of one AAA battery instead of AA (an adapter has its own weight) and rechargeable mice with a POWERCORE module integrated into the body, rather than requiring an add-on piece. A further reduction in weight might be possible by even removing the charging port, so it would be strictly designed for the recharging pad.3. Weight: G305 is light in weight, especially with an AAA battery, just under 90g, but it can be even lighter with a more aggressive design. Of course punched holes in the shell are not necessary and even not ideal as stronger and lighter thin shell is possible with a well designed construction. Although it is a marketing strategy, it reveals that consumers are not scared of seeing electronic components. It might be a useful thing to keep in mind when designing mice with replaceable batteries in order to reduce unneeded plastic used around battery compartments.4. Shape: I am a fingertip grip user. My hand is slightly over 7 inches from the end of my wrist to the tip of my middle finger. I probably have smaller than average hand for a guy, but likely about average overall. I really like the shape and size of G305 as well as the placement of its buttons and the texture of the plastic. It is not perfect, but it comes the closest compared to many gaming mice I’ve tried or used over the years. I do think that there is a small room for improvement, which I am showing in the image that I have included, but any changes made to the shape need to be handled with restraint. The only two areas of improvement that I see is making the mouse slightly wider with more ergonomic curves designed for right hand use only (with a separate left hand version).5. Buttons: I really like the number of buttons on G305 as well as their placement and mechanism. The mechanism for the two main buttons in particular is a great design which has been used by many of the top Logitech mice for years now, but it does lower the tension which makes the buttons too sensitive. My favorite buttons on a mouse were from Logitech G9x, and although great I wish the main buttons on G305 had the same mechanism as the ones on G9x. Additionally, there is a flaw and an obvious overlook during quality control in the design of G305’s two side buttons. The small PCB onto which the side switches are mounted is either thinner than originally intended, or ended up not quite in the right place, allowing a small gap between the plunger of the switches and the plastic buttons, making it necessary to press the buttons much deeper than they need to be in order to actuate the switches. I was able to fix the issue, but not without opening the mouse.6. Switches: This is an area that is long overdue for an overhaul. I’m not sure which company first started the trend many years ago of publishing the durability of their switches in number of clicks (10, 20, 30, 40 million), but sadly we have all fallen into a trap set by marketing pressures. Omron, the company that manufactures the switches do sell retail Omron switches with a branding on them Omron Japan, but not rated for this high number of clicks. Apparently some time ago mouse manufacturers decided to start using non-retail switches from Omron, likely at lower prices, which they then tested in-house and assigned the 20 million clicks that their marketing department made us think we need to have in our mice. The only problem being is that those non-retail switches are actually more often than not lower quality than their retail versions and the 20 million clicks rating being absolutely meaningless as it doesn’t represent real life variable pressure usage over time. When once the buttons of a regular mouse that came with an old PC might last for 10 years now might only last a few months before a “20 million” switch starts to misbehave. In case somebody is wondering, Omron D2F-01F for the primary buttons and Omron D2F-01 for the secondary buttons is what we need to have back in our mice. The F version has about half the actuation force, which is great for instant response and effortless repeated clicks, while the other version gives better tactility.7. Scroll wheel: It seems that for the most part a good design has become a standard among gaming mice. This means no side tilt, no free-spin, and step scrolling with just the right amount of force and feedback. Before buying G Pro I used G303 for about a year and a half. I can see a very clear evolution in the mechanism and encoders being used between G303, G Pro wired and G305. G303 had a fantastic scroll wheel with the only flaw being prone to debris interfering with the encoder sensor. G Pro wired used an encoder that becomes too loose, while G305 is pretty much perfect. There is room for improvement, however. The rubber ridges on the wheel of the G305 are unnecessarily small and pronounced, feeling unpleasantly sharp. The rubber texture of the G903 is a good example of a perfect rubber ring for a scroll wheel. The other area that can be improved is the middle button, and more specifically its switch. The mechanism of the wheel in G305 looks great and will likely allow the middle button to actuate with the same amount of force and give the same feedback as the other secondary buttons, but the switch needs to be Omron D2F-01. Currently the small switch that’s used is fine, but there are mice with Omron sized switches in the middle button and it is definitely an improvement.8. Software: G HUB needs refinement. This has always been a strong point for Logitech, and their software continues to be great both in terms of functionality and stability, but their new interface needs to be simplified for ease of use.9. Feet: The original feet are fine, but I didn’t use the mouse with them very long as I had to remove them in order to open the mouse to fix or change some of the parts as discussed above. Unfortunately Logitech still does not sell spare mouse feet for this mouse. This might be due to the fact that for some reason they decided to make one of them very small and with a different thickness than the other four mouse feet. Can we please have all mouse feet the same thickness, not have too many and too small, and not have them cover the screw holes?This would have to be it for now. As always don’t forget to disable “Enhance pointer precision” in Windows mouse settings, and in the unlikely event that somebody from Microsoft reads this, if possible, please kindly make it disabled by default, or better yet, remove the option completely. Thank you very much, and we’ll be grateful for years to come."}

It's incredibly accurate and responsive, ensuring your every movement is translated flawlessly on-screen. This is a significant advantage for gamers who demand precision.5. Good Battery Life: While it's not the best among wireless mice with swappable batteries, the G305's battery life is still respectable. It keeps you gaming for hours before needing a battery change.Cons:1. Non-Rechargeable: One notable drawback is that the G305 relies on swappable batteries instead of being rechargeable. While this allows for uninterrupted gaming by swapping batteries, it can be a hassle to source and replace them.2. Limited Software Customization: The Logitech G-Hub software, while functional, leaves something to be desired in terms of customization options. I wish it offered more advanced features to truly unlock the mouse's potential.3. Easily Pressed Side Buttons: The side buttons, while of good quality, are somewhat prone to accidental presses due to their placement. This may be a minor inconvenience for some users.4. Prone to Dirt: The white variant of the G305 is a stunner, but it does attract dirt and smudges relatively easily. Regular cleaning is needed to keep it looking pristine.Overall, at a price point of $35, the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in white is an exceptional buy. Its swift wireless connectivity, tactile clicks, comfortable design for claw grip users, and blazing sensor speed make it a top-notch gaming mouse. While rechargeability and more comprehensive software features would be nice additions, they don't detract significantly from the overall value. If you're looking for a budget-friendly yet high-performance gaming mouse, the G305 is an excellent choice that won't disappoint."}

{"asin": "B07CMS5Q6P", "username": "Christopher Davies", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nMaybe best price/performance on market", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackPattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I rated 5/5 because I think what you get for the money is good, not because it's perfect (at the time of writing I paid $30 including shipping). I'm going to rate the aspects important to me in a mouse on a scale of 10 and give a brief description why, as someone who games competitively.Shape/Form: 9/10Medium-size form factor. Nothing innovative here but it doesn't have to be. It's comfortable to use and cups in the palm nicely.Weight: 8/10I'm still not sure if there's a point where a mouse can be TOO light. I personally haven't found that point yet. I've used lighter mice than this and didn't notice much of a difference. I don't feel any extra fatigue using this one. Make no mistake though, this is a light mouse.Buttons: 9/10It's not loaded with a bunch of extra buttons and I like that. Buttons are what a keyboard is for, not a mouse. That said it has robust mapping options in the software for the buttons it does have. I don't do any special mappings but it's nice the option's there. I had to dock a point for the left and right click. I find the pressure threshold for clicking is TOO sensitive, to the point the mere gravity of my finger resting on the buttons engages a click. This resulted in me needing to permanently flex back my index and ring fingers so they wouldn't trigger clicks. As a result I had to fold up a little piece of paper and slide it under the corners of the buttons to increase the pressure.. This was an easy hack so it doesn't really bother me. It would be nice to have some mechanism to adjust click pressure in future models though.Wireless: 8/10The reception is good, it feels about as responsive as a wired mouse. I'll only very occasionally get some response stalling for a 1/4 cm of movement of the mouse before it registers. And this only seems to happen if the cursor sits in the same position for a prolonged period of time. You also have to use a special dongle. It's not the end of the world and I understand it's for better performance, but it takes up another slot in your usb real estate and it would be nicer if I could use 1 dongle for all my peripherals instead of 2.DPI: 8/10This thing advertises 12K DPI and I bought it as a replacement for their 1K DPI standard logi mouse I got for $20. I have no way to test this but it doesn't feel 12x faster. At max settings it feels 2x faster or AT MOST 3x. Now it could be some of this dpi is being used for smoother transitions between points of movement and it does feel smoother and less choppy than the $20 logi. It's max speed setting is pretty good though. It's hard to imagine you'd want much faster than this. It could still be smoother though and if it is indeed 12K dpi as advertised then I could imagine even higher dpi's could be beneficial for the most elite levels of gaming. I think I'd prefere just a touch more sensitivity myself but this is very usable for competitive gaming and I think this would meet the demands of 99.9% of gamers.Closing Thoughts:Good mouse for the money. In the consumer electronics space in general I'd like to see some independent labs open up to test these electronics and confirm their claims of performance. I think logitech is a reputable company and I'm inclined to trust this mouse wields 12K dpi, but how could I ever confirm this? The residential electronics market has already solved this with the common UL (UnderwriterLabs) symbol marking system. This is a seal of quality and an independent confirmation of performance by an independent lab. This ensures reliable performance and protects the consumer against fraud. The current system we have for consumer electronics of relying on reviewers to write (potentially compromised) sponsored reviews is inadequate at this point. There are too many devices out there and the research expected of a single consumer to sift through this endless catalog is far too much."}

Looks nice with grey top and black accents. Fits nicely in my hand. Not too large or small. Buttons/wheel operate perfectly. There is a 'wake up' button behind the wheel that is a great touch. Wheel has a nice soft roll and a smart click to enable auto scroll. There is an on/off button underneath but I don't use it as the mouse goes to sleep after a few minutes to save the battery.I plugged in the small USB and the mouse began functioning after a few seconds with no programming or problems. This is a rechargeable unit and comes with a USB cable. It had enough charge out of the box to give it a try. Plugged it in and charged until the light changed. Maybe one hour. I've been using it several hours a day for about a month and have yet to have to recharge. It glides nicely across the several surfaces where I use it.

Build is plastic-y and first impression seems like it might be a touch flimsy. However, charged it up, plugged in the usb communicator, turned it on, and away we've gone. Works well. It will occasionally \"glitch\" with a skip here and there. It also goes to sleep a touch sooner than I would like. But all you have to do is press a button or the scroll wheel and it wakes up. When laptop is shutdown, the mouse shuts down. So you don't have to worry about physically turning it on and off. I've had it maybe 2 months? I've only charged it once, when I first got it. That's pretty good. It does have a place in the mouse body to house the usb communicator. But I keep it plugged into my laptop so I haven't had a need to hide it there. But it is a nice touch when I will need to take it out for some reason for it to have a place to go and not get lost. For the price I'm very happy. I use it for work and just internet stuff. I don't do gaming so I can't tell you how it will work for that. If you are hardcore on a mouse, I'm not sure how well it well take abuse.

Picture on review.All in all it's more expensive than it should be. I just noticed the top and bottom portion don't align perfectly so I can feel it sloping the the right and the coating on the top may not be uniform because I have 2 very minor rougher spots. Quaility control is what you'd expect from a cheap Chinese product. Would not use this if you're serious about gaming or extended work time with a mouse. Ergonomic between a cheap mouse like this and Logitech near the same price is a world of difference.Laptop mouse: 8Gaming mouse: 4Office mouse: 5"}

I ended up losing the USB connector because I was careless, so I went and bought another one since I started summer classes and needed a mouse for in-person class.IT STILL WORKS THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL ONE I FIRST BOUGHT.Pros-It is perfect for taking tests, quizzes, and browsing the web during lectures.-The click and the movement of the mouse on a school desk/long table WITHOUT a mouse pad is good. The tracking does not lag at all.-The clicking is completely silent.-The scroll wheel does make some noise and is noticeable in a completely quiet setting. Not so noticeable if several people are talking, or if the professor is loud enough.-Consistent-Subtle design-Perfect for tiny hands (tiny adult hands mine would have just enough of a tight fight in small gloves, slightly loose to normal fit in medium gloves)-Purchased $12.99 discounted from 14.99, $13.50 w/ tax.-Charge is still good and lasts weeks before needing another charge (usage has decreased to 6 hours a week)"}

Used it daily for hours. Plastic began to have a divot where I clicked. Dropped it multiple times. After a particularly hard knock, it began to be a bit finicky, but it didn't owe me anything! This is a great, durable, easy to use mouse and I gladly ordered another.I ordered this mouse about a month ago. Arrived in 3 days via Prime.I ordered the 'Grey' color. Looks nice with grey top and black accents. Fits nicely in my hand. Not too large or small. Buttons/wheel operate perfectly. There is a 'wake up' button behind the wheel that is a great touch. Wheel has a nice soft roll and a smart click to enable auto scroll. There is an on/off button underneath but I don't use it as the mouse goes to sleep after a few minutes to save the battery.I plugged in the small USB and the mouse began functioning after a few seconds with no programming or problems. This is a rechargeable unit and comes with a USB cable. It had enough charge out of the box to give it a try. Plugged it in and charged until the light changed. Maybe one hour. I've been using it several hours a day for about a month and have yet to have to recharge. It glides nicely across the several surfaces where I use it. Works especially well on the leather arm of my easy chair!I'm very pleased with this unit and would recommend it. The price is in line with the quality.This is a great unit."}

I like the fact that I don't have to get batteries for it. I really don't like the fact that it is micro-usb!! I mean, usb-c is the least you'd expect, but since I use it for my pc, it's not a big problem.I like that that it doesn't have side buttons! That's a win for me. The click is sustisfying and never double clicks. It's comfortable and accurate.You will notice when the battery starts to drain it will get slower and needs a re-charge. It can go on for about a week before I have to re-charge it, which is not so bad. I have had it for 4 months now and the battery is still solid. Will update this review when it starts to get worse...Update: 9 months after useThe wheel stopped working. Considering the cheap price, I wouldn't say it's a bad deal, but I wouldn't get it again!"}

Build is plastic-y and first impression seems like it might be a touch flimsy. However, charged it up, plugged in the usb communicator, turned it on, and away we've gone. Works well. It will occasionally \"glitch\" with a skip here and there. It also goes to sleep a touch sooner than I would like. But all you have to do is press a button or the scroll wheel and it wakes up. When laptop is shutdown, the mouse shuts down. So you don't have to worry about physically turning it on and off. I've had it maybe 2 months? I've only charged it once, when I first got it. That's pretty good. It does have a place in the mouse body to house the usb communicator. But I keep it plugged into my laptop so I haven't had a need to hide it there. But it is a nice touch when I will need to take it out for some reason for it to have a place to go and not get lost. For the price I'm very happy. I use it for work and just internet stuff. I don't do gaming so I can't tell you how it will work for that. If you are hardcore on a mouse, I'm not sure how well it well take abuse. But for everyday \"normal\" use, it should hold up just fine."}

But you already know that. My initial impressions + pictures for scale:Pros:• Coating on the top portion is lovely, doesn't feel like it'll last too long but I could be wrong.• Left and right clicks are quiet.• Rechargable and comes with cable (no wall plug)• Bluetooth receiver is magnetic to the hole it goes in under the mouse.• DPI switch is useful.• SmallCons:• Feet are very short, I see them going out decently quick on normal surfaces (use a cloth mousepad if you respect yourself).• Scroll wheel click and DPI switch are the generic \"click\" sounds which doesn't make any sense on a \"silent\" mouse.• Rest of the body is cheap plastic• Charging port (on the front where a wire would be on a wired mouse) has a bit of the glossy plastic from the top coving a portion of it. Picture on review.All in all it's more expensive than it should be. I just noticed the top and bottom portion don't align perfectly so I can feel it sloping the the right and the coating on the top may not be uniform because I have 2 very minor rougher spots. Quaility control is what you'd expect from a cheap Chinese product. Would not use this if you're serious about gaming or extended work time with a mouse. Ergonomic between a cheap mouse like this and Logitech near the same price is a world of difference.Laptop mouse: 8Gaming mouse: 4Office mouse: 5"}

You can turn it off with the bottom switch or leave it on; it will go to sleep if not being used and only requires a mouse click to wake back up. Technically, the mouse clicks are not completely silent - more like a very soft, muffled sound. But in a room with normal sounds (TV, talking, gaming, etc...) you more feel the clicks with your finger than hear with you ear. Using the default 1600 dpi has worked for fine for me.

The top feels soft.  The \"clicks\" are responsive but also soft (soft sounding).  I've had mice with tighter scroll wheels, but this one works well.  When inactive for a long period of time, the mouse turns itself off and awakes on the next \"click\".  And the \"click to wake\" option is nice for me because, for some reason, my keyboard keys don't wake my computer.It has an interesting feature.  The button, on top, modifies the mouse speed sensitivity.  Not how fast the computer tracks the mouse, that's a separate slider in the driver config (through you Mouse Control Pane).  No, this is just the data the mouse sends the computer.  It's fast and has (something like) 6 speeds.I've had it two weeks and I haven't had to charge it since I took it out of the box."}

You can turn it off with the bottom switch or leave it on; it will go to sleep if not being used and only requires a mouse click to wake back up. Technically, the mouse clicks are not completely silent - more like a very soft, muffled sound. But in a room with normal sounds (TV, talking, gaming, etc...) you more feel the clicks with your finger than hear with you ear. Using the default 1600 dpi has worked for fine for me. This mouse is not tall in an ergonomic way, but being slimmer makes it more compact and easier to stow in the laptop bag. Its a good mouse for the price."}

Unlike those 9.9 bucks mouse, it has a built in battery that is rechargeable, very convenient, I don't need to replace battery any more. What’s more, I like the considerate USB nano receiver store slot design, it has a built in magnet, the nano receiver will be sucked in automatically when you put it close to the store slot in the back of the mouse, I no longer need to worry about losing it. Meanwhile, I tested it on both my Mac Book and my windows PC, it works pretty well. In addition, it's super quiet; you can barely hear the click. In general, this mouse is totally worth every buck that spent. Highly recommend to you all."}

Also the USB you hook up into your computer is smaller than some other ones and it doesn't get in the way of handling your notebook! (the bigger ones stick out so you get scared that you will bend it accidentally) Also after you charge the mouse it lasts a long time.

It's a super agile and high-quality mouse in terms of its software, but don't expect insanely high quality for its physical build. After a year of using it, the battery inside ended up detaching, and I found myself lazy to take off the skates to remove implant the batter back in place; however, this always caused an annoying shaky sound whenever I would flick my mouse. In addition to this, I had originally lost the wireless USB that plugs into the micro-usb cable the mouse comes with, and I ended up having to use my superlight wired for about three months. I did not enjoy using it wired, and I don't believe you would either. The mouse is already precise in itself when it's wireless.Battery life:Despite the annoying battery sounds, the battery life on this mouse is insane. This will last your DAYS if not, almost a WEEK of usage. I found this mouse to be highly reliable with everyday use and gaming! Even that, charging the mouse doesn't take a long time, just don't be lazy and deal with sticking with wired for an hour or two, or just charge while you sleep!Software:The software is great on this mouse, during my experience, I appreciated the software with the ability to set custom DPI's that suited what I was doing whether it would be playing an FPS, or performing precisely sensitive activities on my computer.Pros:It's 61 grams, and it packs a punch in gaming. The battery life will last you ages, and the mouse will do what you desire. It is extremely precise, and highly reliable in intense FPS situations, and just comfortable for everyday use.Cons:The mouse uses a yucky mico-usb cable, and I wasn't always fond of it. However, the cable does the job, and the mouse doesn't disappoint. Additionally, if you end up losing the usb that the micro-usb plugs into, be aware that is DIFFICULT to find a replacement, and you may end up buying a weird third-party rather than Logitech certified.Verdict:Don't lose the wireless USB the mouse comes with, and just enjoy the experience! You're paying an insane amount for a light mouse and I highly recommend it. It's egg shell shape is comfortable and it's a classic of Logitech's features."}

I owned this for almost a year and I had no issues with it whatsoever.PROS- WirelessI love that it’s wireless and it gives a much cleaner look on my desk. I had no issues with it disconnecting from my computer. There is also no difference from this mouse from a wired mouse in terms of input delay. So your not putting yourself at a disadvantage whatsoever if you play any fast paced shooter games competitively.- Amazing battery lifeThe battery life on this mouse is insane. You can use this mouse everyday for weeks and it will still have battery life left. I don’t know how Logitech did it but you won’t have to worry about charging this thing weekly.- LightweightThis mouse is very lightweight as per the name and I love it. But for some people this may be a negative to some people so it’s important to think about if you like a heavy mouse or lighter mouse. But for me I personally love it.- Side ButtonsThere are side buttons that you can use to program using the :ogitech software. Not much to say about them other than they work and this mouse has them.CONS- Uses micro usbI hate how this mouse uses a micro usb to charge, albeit you will not be charging this mouse a lot but when the day comes to charge it’s very annoying. Also the charging cable that came with this mouse is shaped in a way that makes it so that the cable can only fit in this mouse. It’s a little weird why they did that but it’s not a big deal. If you want to bypass using a micro usb cable then you can buy a dock that you can leave your mouse to charge on and now you never need to worry about having to charge the mouse.- No dpi buttonThere is no dpi button in the middle of the mouse to change the dpi if you care about that. I never change my dpi so it’s not a big deal to me but it’s important to keep in mind if you do change your dpi for games.- SmallThis mouse is a little small but should fit most hands but if you have very big hands then this mouse will not feel comfortable to hold. For me it fits just fine.This is probably one of the best wireless gaming mice that you can find in the market. The only other option that is similar to this is the glorious model O wireless. The mouse has a dpi button in the middle and can charge using usb-c. The only problem is that I hated how the mouse had many holes and you also can’t charge the mouse on a dock unlike the superlight. So in my personal opinion I think the superlight is the better option."}

{"asin": "B087LXCTFJ", "username": "E F", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nA true top tier mouse", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021", "purchased": "Color: BlackStyle: Generation 1Pattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I've had this mouse for a couple of weeks now after replacing my Razer Viper and it has been worth every penny since.  I was initially upgrading from the viper since the grip was wearing and it began to squeak a little.  The viper was by far my favorite shape in any mouse while having the best sounding switches to me, but I needed something to last me longer than what it had done for me.  The ultimate version of the viper which happens to be wireless which is something that I've been wanting to try long term now is simply too low profile which makes it hard for me to grip with with a claw grip.  Since this was the case I was shopping around and found the g pro x superlight which beats it in almost every spec which was lucky for me.  This mouse is one of the lightest none honeycomb mice on the market and of every wireless mouse out there I believe that it is the lightest so it has a lot going for it on top of the usual top tier sensor that all expensive mice have.  Another advantage that the g pro x has over the viper is that the scroll wheel is very smooth and easy to use while being noticeably stepped as to not accidentally scroll.  Though there is one downside of which I don't really consider a knock against the g pro as it more praise for the viper as logitech typically has quite high pitched mouse clicks which are not too noticeable with headphones on.  Once again that isn't so much a problem that logitech has so much as one of its characteristics that it shares with many mice all around and the one exception would be the razer viper (also the newer razer mice that have switched to their optical switches which sound much quieter and bassier by comparison).Adjusting was fairly easy for me since it suits claw grips quite well even if it felt a bit smaller than my viper and the fact that it is lighter even if by only 6 grams is very noticeable once you don't have a cable attached.  Previously I had quite a nice bungee setup with my viper to accommodate an already very light weight, but it simply can't hold a candle to a super light mouse with NO cable at all.  Performance is stellar as I have mentioned, beating my razer viper which I had previously considered to be the king of all gaming mice at the time, except for one minor hiccup that I had out of the box;  Upon opening up the box and getting the mouse all set up immediately by plugging in the wireless dongle into the front of my PC, I noticed with my initial gaming/testing that it would be \"skipping\" around and simply not register at times.  This was caused more than likely by tons of interference from a bluetooth transmitter for my tv, one from my PC for my controller and more miscellaneous wireless connections, but once I used the cable with the adapter to put the dongle right on my desk with clear line of sight, it has not had even one issue.Over the two weeks that I've had this mouse, I've only had to charge it once as I've noticed that it loses roughly 7% per day with a few hour gaming session and quite a bit of web browsing and general work on my computer throughout the day.  It wakes up from \"sleep\" instantly so it's never unresponsive even though it has quite an aggressive sleep cycle where it goes to sleep after roughly 5 minutes of inactivity.So, if you're looking for a top tier gaming mouse that does it all with 0 compromises, this is definitely the mouse for you.  Another bonus is that the mouse came with rubber grips if you need them which I found quite helpful with the razer viper, but due to the generally small figure of the g pro I don't find it necessary.  It also surprisingly comes with extra skates which will wear out over time, so this is quite the thoughtful addition that will come in handy from my experience with quite a few other mice.  Now for the most important part, is the value as it is quite pricey;  I don't think that it's an amazing value considering there's top tier competitors around $30 from Logitech themselves to Razer to Steelseries and more in that ultra-budget range up to $80 or so where mice have almost identical performance on paper; Though you do have to take into account that this mouse is wireless and there's about one other mouse that can even compete with it because of that which is the Razer Viper Ultimate.  The RVU is cheaper by a considerable amount especially once you factor in sales, so that note I'd recommend it purely for the fact that it would be the best mouse you could get at that price point, but the G Pro x is still not completely comparable.  Of the Logitech mice that I've had over the years, the G403 and G602, they've both held up extremely well aside from the grip failing a bit on the G403 of which the G Pro does not have since it's an add-on and because of that I circle back to recommending this mouse since while I haven't had it for as long, I can say based off Logitech's track record, it'll last."}

I used it for a day before trying my old mouse, a Razer DeathAdder Chroma again, and the difference was astronomical. Switching to the mouse may not be as noticeable since you'll have been used to using a mouse of a heavier weight, but switching back will tell you all you need to know.At first, I was a little iffy on the product, even with the Prime sale going on, giving it a slight discount, down to around $120ish after tax. But it was definitely worth it, especially if it is as durable as I have heard it is.If you're going for a general work/office mouse, then it may be a bit overkill, but used for gaming and a variety of different things, then it should suit your needs completely."}
{"asin": "B087LXCTFJ", "username": "Julian", "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat mouse, but a horrible scroll wheel problem.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackStyle: Generation 1Pattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I remember looking for a new mouse to buy and finally gave in to buying the super light despite it costing an absurd ~120 dollars. Given its high reviews and popularity I trusted that it would be a quality mouse and last me a long time with no problems, but only a few months in there's one annoying flaw that is probably fixable- but I think is worth writing a review for given how much I've paid for this thing.Pros:-Plug and play-Switching from wired to wireless has removed the annoying wire that may get stuck on anything, or hindered your movement if you're dragging your mouse up or down against the weight of the cord. Combine that with the mouse's low latency, and my aim in fps games has been the best it's ever been.-The mouse needs to recharge, but it can last a few good days of constant use without needing to be charged (also without ever turning the mouse off from the bottom). It comes with a cable that can charge the mouse or be used to extend the usb signal, and the mouse can be used while charging/connected. The mouse will slowly glow a small green dot on the middle of the mouse when it's charging, have no light when it's done charging or is in use, stay a solid red color when it is low and needs to be charged, and then continually glow red when it is very low on battery. The semi transparent dot where the light glows is barely noticeable when there are no lights. Mouse does not take too long to fully charge.-It is light. If you've used one of the Glorious mice with the holes on them, it's pretty similar in weight. Also, there are none of those annoying holes like the Glorious mice. The amount of dirt and dust that can get trapped inside inside those is disgusting, so +1 for being able to craft a lightweight mouse without needing to do that.Cons:-The mouse has a sort of protective coating to prevent skin oils from smoothing out your mouse buttons, but the area where my pinky rests on the mouse has had that coating scraped off due to what I imagine is my finger nail scratching against the mouse, revealing a smoother texture. It's not a major flaw, and every other part of the mouse is fine, but I just wanted to state what you might expect if you rest your pinky on it with a sort of claw grip.-No dedicated DPI button. You can use Logitech's software to change your DPI or change the function of one of the buttons to switch between them, but the mouse doesnt have any extra buttons besides the normal two clicky buttons, middle click, and the forward+backward mouse keys.-The forward+backward buttons are said to be 'mushy' or described like pressing a controller button, but I personally prefer this feeling compared to the stiff immediate feedback other mice may provide. So, possible con for someone who's not used to this?-Might be a bit small for big hands if you rest your entire hand over it-The major annoying flaw I've had is the scroll wheel. Over a few months of continuous use, the scroll wheel gets a greater chance of scrolling up when you want to scroll down, and vice versa. It is a physical problem, so while some people may say to reduce the scroll sensitivity via software, this would not work as the problem is so bad that the first scroll you do will process the scroll in the complete opposite direction. To save you the time of researching the solution to this, I found a reddit post explaining that you can open up the mouse (if you can find something to unscrew the unconventionally tiny screws with) and apply a layer of masking tape to the part of the mouse that receives the bump from the scroll, and that should apply some level of resistance so your scroll wheel doesn't roll back into the opposite direction. I haven't gotten to this yet as I'd need to carefully remove the mouse skates I purchased and applied, and again, pretty annoying to have this problem having paid so much.

It's a super agile and high-quality mouse in terms of its software, but don't expect insanely high quality for its physical build. After a year of using it, the battery inside ended up detaching, and I found myself lazy to take off the skates to remove implant the batter back in place; however, this always caused an annoying shaky sound whenever I would flick my mouse. In addition to this, I had originally lost the wireless USB that plugs into the micro-usb cable the mouse comes with, and I ended up having to use my superlight wired for about three months. I did not enjoy using it wired, and I don't believe you would either. The mouse is already precise in itself when it's wireless.Battery life:Despite the annoying battery sounds, the battery life on this mouse is insane. This will last your DAYS if not, almost a WEEK of usage. I found this mouse to be highly reliable with everyday use and gaming! Even that, charging the mouse doesn't take a long time, just don't be lazy and deal with sticking with wired for an hour or two, or just charge while you sleep!Software:The software is great on this mouse, during my experience, I appreciated the software with the ability to set custom DPI's that suited what I was doing whether it would be playing an FPS, or performing precisely sensitive activities on my computer.Pros:It's 61 grams, and it packs a punch in gaming. The battery life will last you ages, and the mouse will do what you desire. It is extremely precise, and highly reliable in intense FPS situations, and just comfortable for everyday use.Cons:The mouse uses a yucky mico-usb cable, and I wasn't always fond of it. However, the cable does the job, and the mouse doesn't disappoint. Additionally, if you end up losing the usb that the micro-usb plugs into, be aware that is DIFFICULT to find a replacement, and you may end up buying a weird third-party rather than Logitech certified.Verdict:Don't lose the wireless USB the mouse comes with, and just enjoy the experience! You're paying an insane amount for a light mouse and I highly recommend it. It's egg shell shape is comfortable and it's a classic of Logitech's features."}

I owned this for almost a year and I had no issues with it whatsoever.PROS- WirelessI love that it’s wireless and it gives a much cleaner look on my desk. I had no issues with it disconnecting from my computer. There is also no difference from this mouse from a wired mouse in terms of input delay. So your not putting yourself at a disadvantage whatsoever if you play any fast paced shooter games competitively.- Amazing battery lifeThe battery life on this mouse is insane. You can use this mouse everyday for weeks and it will still have battery life left. I don’t know how Logitech did it but you won’t have to worry about charging this thing weekly.- LightweightThis mouse is very lightweight as per the name and I love it. But for some people this may be a negative to some people so it’s important to think about if you like a heavy mouse or lighter mouse. But for me I personally love it.- Side ButtonsThere are side buttons that you can use to program using the :ogitech software. Not much to say about them other than they work and this mouse has them.CONS- Uses micro usbI hate how this mouse uses a micro usb to charge, albeit you will not be charging this mouse a lot but when the day comes to charge it’s very annoying. Also the charging cable that came with this mouse is shaped in a way that makes it so that the cable can only fit in this mouse. It’s a little weird why they did that but it’s not a big deal. If you want to bypass using a micro usb cable then you can buy a dock that you can leave your mouse to charge on and now you never need to worry about having to charge the mouse.- No dpi buttonThere is no dpi button in the middle of the mouse to change the dpi if you care about that. I never change my dpi so it’s not a big deal to me but it’s important to keep in mind if you do change your dpi for games.- SmallThis mouse is a little small but should fit most hands but if you have very big hands then this mouse will not feel comfortable to hold. For me it fits just fine.This is probably one of the best wireless gaming mice that you can find in the market. The only other option that is similar to this is the glorious model O wireless. The mouse has a dpi button in the middle and can charge using usb-c. The only problem is that I hated how the mouse had many holes and you also can’t charge the mouse on a dock unlike the superlight. So in my personal opinion I think the superlight is the better option."}

I was initially upgrading from the viper since the grip was wearing and it began to squeak a little.  The viper was by far my favorite shape in any mouse while having the best sounding switches to me, but I needed something to last me longer than what it had done for me.  The ultimate version of the viper which happens to be wireless which is something that I've been wanting to try long term now is simply too low profile which makes it hard for me to grip with with a claw grip.  Since this was the case I was shopping around and found the g pro x superlight which beats it in almost every spec which was lucky for me.  This mouse is one of the lightest none honeycomb mice on the market and of every wireless mouse out there I believe that it is the lightest so it has a lot going for it on top of the usual top tier sensor that all expensive mice have.  Another advantage that the g pro x has over the viper is that the scroll wheel is very smooth and easy to use while being noticeably stepped as to not accidentally scroll.  Though there is one downside of which I don't really consider a knock against the g pro as it more praise for the viper as logitech typically has quite high pitched mouse clicks which are not too noticeable with headphones on.  Once again that isn't so much a problem that logitech has so much as one of its characteristics that it shares with many mice all around and the one exception would be the razer viper (also the newer razer mice that have switched to their optical switches which sound much quieter and bassier by comparison).Adjusting was fairly easy for me since it suits claw grips quite well even if it felt a bit smaller than my viper and the fact that it is lighter even if by only 6 grams is very noticeable once you don't have a cable attached.  Previously I had quite a nice bungee setup with my viper to accommodate an already very light weight, but it simply can't hold a candle to a super light mouse with NO cable at all.  Performance is stellar as I have mentioned, beating my razer viper which I had previously considered to be the king of all gaming mice at the time, except for one minor hiccup that I had out of the box;  Upon opening up the box and getting the mouse all set up immediately by plugging in the wireless dongle into the front of my PC, I noticed with my initial gaming/testing that it would be \"skipping\" around and simply not register at times.  This was caused more than likely by tons of interference from a bluetooth transmitter for my tv, one from my PC for my controller and more miscellaneous wireless connections, but once I used the cable with the adapter to put the dongle right on my desk with clear line of sight, it has not had even one issue.Over the two weeks that I've had this mouse, I've only had to charge it once as I've noticed that it loses roughly 7% per day with a few hour gaming session and quite a bit of web browsing and general work on my computer throughout the day.  It wakes up from \"sleep\" instantly so it's never unresponsive even though it has quite an aggressive sleep cycle where it goes to sleep after roughly 5 minutes of inactivity.So, if you're looking for a top tier gaming mouse that does it all with 0 compromises, this is definitely the mouse for you.  Another bonus is that the mouse came with rubber grips if you need them which I found quite helpful with the razer viper, but due to the generally small figure of the g pro I don't find it necessary.  It also surprisingly comes with extra skates which will wear out over time, so this is quite the thoughtful addition that will come in handy from my experience with quite a few other mice.  Now for the most important part, is the value as it is quite pricey;  I don't think that it's an amazing value considering there's top tier competitors around $30 from Logitech themselves to Razer to Steelseries and more in that ultra-budget range up to $80 or so where mice have almost identical performance on paper; Though you do have to take into account that this mouse is wireless and there's about one other mouse that can even compete with it because of that which is the Razer Viper Ultimate.  The RVU is cheaper by a considerable amount especially once you factor in sales, so that note I'd recommend it purely for the fact that it would be the best mouse you could get at that price point, but the G Pro x is still not completely comparable.  Of the Logitech mice that I've had over the years, the G403 and G602, they've both held up extremely well aside from the grip failing a bit on the G403 of which the G Pro does not have since it's an add-on and because of that I circle back to recommending this mouse since while I haven't had it for as long, I can say based off Logitech's track record, it'll last."}

But it was definitely worth it, especially if it is as durable as I have heard it is.If you're going for a general work/office mouse, then it may be a bit overkill, but used for gaming and a variety of different things, then it should suit your needs completely."}

Given its high reviews and popularity I trusted that it would be a quality mouse and last me a long time with no problems, but only a few months in there's one annoying flaw that is probably fixable- but I think is worth writing a review for given how much I've paid for this thing.Pros:-Plug and play-Switching from wired to wireless has removed the annoying wire that may get stuck on anything, or hindered your movement if you're dragging your mouse up or down against the weight of the cord. Combine that with the mouse's low latency, and my aim in fps games has been the best it's ever been.-The mouse needs to recharge, but it can last a few good days of constant use without needing to be charged (also without ever turning the mouse off from the bottom). It comes with a cable that can charge the mouse or be used to extend the usb signal, and the mouse can be used while charging/connected. The mouse will slowly glow a small green dot on the middle of the mouse when it's charging, have no light when it's done charging or is in use, stay a solid red color when it is low and needs to be charged, and then continually glow red when it is very low on battery. The semi transparent dot where the light glows is barely noticeable when there are no lights. Mouse does not take too long to fully charge.-It is light. If you've used one of the Glorious mice with the holes on them, it's pretty similar in weight. Also, there are none of those annoying holes like the Glorious mice. The amount of dirt and dust that can get trapped inside inside those is disgusting, so +1 for being able to craft a lightweight mouse without needing to do that.Cons:-The mouse has a sort of protective coating to prevent skin oils from smoothing out your mouse buttons, but the area where my pinky rests on the mouse has had that coating scraped off due to what I imagine is my finger nail scratching against the mouse, revealing a smoother texture. It's not a major flaw, and every other part of the mouse is fine, but I just wanted to state what you might expect if you rest your pinky on it with a sort of claw grip.-No dedicated DPI button. You can use Logitech's software to change your DPI or change the function of one of the buttons to switch between them, but the mouse doesnt have any extra buttons besides the normal two clicky buttons, middle click, and the forward+backward mouse keys.-The forward+backward buttons are said to be 'mushy' or described like pressing a controller button, but I personally prefer this feeling compared to the stiff immediate feedback other mice may provide. So, possible con for someone who's not used to this?-Might be a bit small for big hands if you rest your entire hand over it-The major annoying flaw I've had is the scroll wheel.

I use both scrolling (up and down) along with click it (pushing it in) frequently in the games I play. After about 4ish months I started noticing when I would scroll either up or down. The mouse would scroll a click or 2 (basically one scroll wheel unit observed by the computer) in the opposite direction occasionally. This started to happen more frequently, until eventually it was happening every time. Digging through reddit, this seems to be a pretty common issue for people and one that hasn't been addressed by Logitech. I was able to find a solution to help resolve this issue (turn off the mouse, flip upside down, set mouse wheel on flat clean surface, press down lightly and roll the mouse back and forth along the full mouse wheel range for about a minute). But I have to do it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. For me, this is really annoying and something that I would expect from a mouse marketed as a high end gaming mouse.Overall, I'd say this very good mouse if you don't use your scroll wheel too much. Or really rely on your side buttons.But I would not buy this at full price. Considering the amount of competition in this market you can get a better mouse for the same price (full price) or one of similar quality at a reduced price (about $80-$90)If you see this on sale, I would consider it. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."}

At $150 it's expensive, and you can get 90% the mouse for about 1/3 the price (Thinking specifically of the Pwnage Symm 1 Gen 2). That said, this is still the best mouse I've used. I use my mouse almost exclusively for FPS games, and I thought I was getting old. I was struggling to stay above a 1.0 KD in Destiny 2. I was using a Glorious Model D with a claw/palm hybrid grip. After having it for about a year, I was no longer in love with the Model D, so I decided to give a symmetrical mouse a try, and why not try the king? I switched to this mouse and instantly my DK rose, I'm now sitting around a 1.8 KD, and often get games where I'm over a 3.0. I'm still getting old, but not as old as I thought!The mouse fits my hand pretty well, I'd say the Pwnage mouse feels just slightly better as it flares out a little more at the back of the mouse, but the GPX still feels great. It's the same weight as the Pwnage without needing any holes, which I prefer solid shelled mice, so that's a big plus. The battery life is a major selling point for this mouse as well. I've had it for about two weeks now and I haven't had to charge it yet. That said, one major flaw with this mouse is the mini-USB charging. In 2023, for $150 I'd really expect USB-C, but alas, that's not the case with this mouse.Build quality is fantastic, there's no flex, creaking, or rattling. There's also no pre or post travel with any of the clicks. That said, the side buttons aren't very clicky. They're passible, but a bit mushy.I don't use my gaming PC for productivity, so this isn't a big con, but I wish there was a DPI button behind the scroll wheel. I've always assigned that to Win+Tab, to allow for fast switching between virtual desktops and applications, which really speeds things up when dealing with multiple windows or desktops.

This has mostly been gaming and some browsing the web. As a note, I did buy this when it was on sale. So I take that into consideration when I'm writing this review.I'll break down my pros and cons below:Pros:Very lightGlides smoothlyRecharges very quicklyVery long battery lifeSturdy left and right clickExtremely accurate trackingEasy to modify the DPICons:The side mouse buttons are mushy and feel badThe scroll wheel is not durableSo I want to talk specifically about the scroll wheel. I use both scrolling (up and down) along with click it (pushing it in) frequently in the games I play. After about 4ish months I started noticing when I would scroll either up or down. The mouse would scroll a click or 2 (basically one scroll wheel unit observed by the computer) in the opposite direction occasionally. This started to happen more frequently, until eventually it was happening every time. Digging through reddit, this seems to be a pretty common issue for people and one that hasn't been addressed by Logitech. I was able to find a solution to help resolve this issue (turn off the mouse, flip upside down, set mouse wheel on flat clean surface, press down lightly and roll the mouse back and forth along the full mouse wheel range for about a minute). But I have to do it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. For me, this is really annoying and something that I would expect from a mouse marketed as a high end gaming mouse.Overall, I'd say this very good mouse if you don't use your scroll wheel too much. Or really rely on your side buttons.But I would not buy this at full price. Considering the amount of competition in this market you can get a better mouse for the same price (full price) or one of similar quality at a reduced price (about $80-$90)If you see this on sale, I would consider it. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."}

At $150 it's expensive, and you can get 90% the mouse for about 1/3 the price (Thinking specifically of the Pwnage Symm 1 Gen 2). That said, this is still the best mouse I've used. I use my mouse almost exclusively for FPS games, and I thought I was getting old. I was struggling to stay above a 1.0 KD in Destiny 2. I was using a Glorious Model D with a claw/palm hybrid grip. After having it for about a year, I was no longer in love with the Model D, so I decided to give a symmetrical mouse a try, and why not try the king? I switched to this mouse and instantly my DK rose, I'm now sitting around a 1.8 KD, and often get games where I'm over a 3.0. I'm still getting old, but not as old as I thought!The mouse fits my hand pretty well, I'd say the Pwnage mouse feels just slightly better as it flares out a little more at the back of the mouse, but the GPX still feels great. It's the same weight as the Pwnage without needing any holes, which I prefer solid shelled mice, so that's a big plus. The battery life is a major selling point for this mouse as well. I've had it for about two weeks now and I haven't had to charge it yet. That said, one major flaw with this mouse is the mini-USB charging. In 2023, for $150 I'd really expect USB-C, but alas, that's not the case with this mouse.Build quality is fantastic, there's no flex, creaking, or rattling. There's also no pre or post travel with any of the clicks. That said, the side buttons aren't very clicky. They're passible, but a bit mushy.I don't use my gaming PC for productivity, so this isn't a big con, but I wish there was a DPI button behind the scroll wheel. I've always assigned that to Win+Tab, to allow for fast switching between virtual desktops and applications, which really speeds things up when dealing with multiple windows or desktops. I have a work Mac though, and use gestures for this same functionality, so not a big deal. If you're considering the Pwnage, this does have a remappable button in that location.So, yes, this is still the best mouse I've used, but not a very good deal at its price.

This one is definitely Mac compatible and I can easily switch from PC to Mac with no issues.Battery life is still too soon to tell, but so far I'm thinking PRO X might have better battery life than Model O-'s. I think the LED that Model O- has might have something to do with it and PRO X doesn't have any of that. Even with the Model O-'s LED's turned off, it still drained the battery somehow. It did get better after the update, but so far I'm noticing Logitech PRO X has better battery life.DPI is about the same, I don't really see myself going any more than 2-3000 DPI, but it's an option for both if you need it higher.They both feel different. I honestly prefer Model O-'s (I'm usually claw-grip to fingertip), but I think I can probably get used to the PRO X. I feel like Model O-'s slimmer if that's even a good way to describe it... PRO X just feels a bit awkward at times, but it's definitely more comfortable for palm. They're both really, really light. Model O- is just a little bit heavier (Model O- = 65g // PRO X = 63g).Mouse click is too soon for me to tell, I feel like Model O-'s snappier than PRO X, but maybe it's because I just had the PRO X for about a week and a half now. You can definitely tell that PRO X doesn't click right away when you push down, though. There's a bit of squish to it before it clicks ESPECIALLY the side buttons. Model O- does also, but not so much. Definitely not as bad as PRO X.The software for both are night&day. Glorious, though, is only compatible with PC whereas Logitech, is compatible with both Mac and PC. LGhub is absolutely terrible compared to Glorious' software center. Not sure what's going on, but it's not saving my settings on PC, but having no issues so far with Mac for some reason...I only did 4 stars because of 2 reasons.1.) PRO X only have 5 buttons whereas Model O- have 6. I feel it's necessary to have more buttons for gaming.2.) The price difference. PRO X is way too expensive for what it is. It's literally twice the price as Glorious' Model O- and I feel like there's Very minimal difference between the two.TLDR: PRO X is good to have if you're switching from Mac to PC  a lot, or if you're just a fan of Logitech. It's a good mouse for sure, but if you're worried about the price, Glorious is the way to go. They're both really good mouse. I'd just rather have the mouse work flawlessly for Mac and PC."}

It's not super obnoxious like most mice you'll come across, but it's still loud enough to draw your attention to it. Again, I'm a pretty relaxed gamer, so the games that I /do/ play don't require tremendous amounts of clicks, but if you're somebody that plays games that require more interaction and you don't personally like a \"clicky\" sounding mouse, this isn't for you.Overall though, this is a great mouse and the RGB lighting in my picture doesn't do it justice!

If you're looking for the best bang for the buck and purchasing a new PC gaming set up, this would be the first mouse I recommend.  Also if you're a 3D artist and looking for a mouse with a nice scroll wheel button and scrolling mechanism that works wonderfully with all your 3D software packages, this is the mouse I'd recommend.  For the quality you get, I personally think its cheap and a great deal.  Now, having raved about how good of a deal it is, I'm not going to say it's as good as the Razer Viper Ultimate Wireless that I just recently purchased.  It just isn't that good.  The G203 is considerably heavier than the Viper Ultimate and I have come to really appreciate a lighter mouse.  However, the G203 is solidly built and I'm sure I'll be using the two that I have for several years because they are well built and durable.The DPI sensitivity can be turned up far higher than I would personally ever want (8000 DPI) and I doubt it will be a limiting factor for most people.  It has a 1000Hz pooling rate, which is a far higher refresh rate than any monitor I know of and I doubt you really need much more if any at all for the foreseeable future.  The shape of the body of the mouse is nice, after using the Viper Ultimate, I do wish the G203 was a bit shorter when measured rising up off the mousepad but seriously a minor gripe.  After using the Viper Ultimate, I do wish the backward and forward buttons on the side of the mouse were a bit bigger like the Viper Ultimate but they are workable. The lighting on the mouse is surprisingly pleasing a smooth.  From my experience the Logitech G Hub software is well designed at easy to use.  I heavily prefer G Hub compared to Razer Synapse.  Synapse so often requests log in credentials and it's a rage inducing pain, Logitech in contrast does it the correct way and does not require a log in at all.  You just have to install the software and that's it, it works and it doesn't take up too many system resources.  The cord of this mouse is a bit heavier than some and less flexible than some but it's not bad.  I highly recommend a mouse cord Bungee to go with this mouse, its a great combo if you'd rather not spend the extra coin on a wireless mouse and you can be highly competitive gaming with that set up.  I personally use this mouse with the Thermaltake Tt e SPORTS Galeru Bungee on my work machine and it's awesome.  I tend not to lug around a bungee in my backpack with my laptop but the G203 is my main laptop mouse and I do well in competitive games without the bungee also.This mouse is an easy recommendation for me, I think it's one of the best investments one can make as a PC gamer.  I would guess it's light years better than mice that are included with most if not all prebuilt PC's.  As a long time (25+ years) PC builder, enthusiast and gamer it's hard to put into words how impressive this one mouse is in terms of cost to performance ratio, it's a landmark in my mind.  It's the minimum and the maximum that I feel like you really need to be a strong competitive gamer, everything else is either that extra icing on the cake or the e-waste that will fill a landfills quickly in coming years.  Just my personal guess this mouse could last you 10 years and there wont be a major compelling reason to upgrade outside of weight during that time.  A slow transition to all USB-C maybe could happen and that might be a reason to get a new mouse but honestly this one I think will last you a while if you want it to."}

But minus 0.5 stars for stupid software = 4 stars.IN SHORT:  For the price point it's a slightly above-average daily or light gaming mouse, esp. if you want RGB lighting effects ON all the time. But the software needs to be simpler to use, and there's no mouse button to quickly toggle RGB on/off.FAIL:  Most RGB mice have a button you can hold down to turn RGB lighting On/Off -but NOT this Logitech one.  Instead, download and installation of special software (Logitech \"G Hub\"), and manual fiddling with the settings in that software is required to disable or adjust RGB.YAY:  MOUSE POLLING SPEED OPTIONS (Customizable):I do like the fact you can use the G Hub software to set 4 custom polling speeds on the mouse. I adjusted mine to 400 / 800 / 1200 / 1600.  Pressing the button next to the scroll wheel toggles through the polling speeds. I use 1200 for daily tasks, 1600 for fast games. Slower speeds like 400 or 800 can be useful for more precise mouse pointer movement, such as in some slower puzzle games.SIZE:The G203 mouse is medium/average size (which is fine unless you have very small or very large hands).  It's slightly smaller than the MSI or Corsair mice I typically use. It is lightweight and moves easily. If you have very long fingers, this mouse might be a tad too short for long gaming sessions, comfort-wise. It is approximately 4.55 inches long (not counting cord, of course).BUTTONS & CORD:  Button placement is normal, and the scroll wheel is not loud (unless you spin it hard/fast). Slow scrolling = nearly silent. You can customize button usage in the G Hub software. I use the 2 left-side buttons all the time (default is Page Up/ Page Down, but you can change that if desired). The attached USB cord is nothing special; not thick, not braided, but adequate.G HUB SOFTWARE = SO-SO (useful, but not simple):Note:  You do NOT have to install the G Hub software --  but without it you can NOT change the RGB, can NOT customize the polling times, and can NOT customize the button functions or anything else. But the mouse will work as a 'plug and play' right out of the bo... with the default poll times, and RGB lighting always glowing.For me, the G Hub software was not very inutitive to use. For help, use a search engine and keywords such as \"logitech g hub disable rgb g203 mouse.\" Took me a while to figure out how to save my settings in the built-in mouse memory (rather than depending on background software G Hub).I'd buy another Logitech mouse, but not THIS model. From now on:  no mice that don't have a built-in button for RGB on/off, out of the box.TIPS:1. You may wish to later Disable (or set to 'manual') the \"LGHUB Updater Service\" Windows service that Logitech G Hub software installs without asking you. Mouse software isn't updated often, and there's no need to have that service running constantly in background.2. Optionally, you can manually UNinstall the Logitech G Hub software, AFTER setting things up the way you like -- but be sure to FIRST set the built-in mouse memory to remember your settings (in G Hub Software)."}

You can set the mouse speed to as fast as you want and adjust it to your liking, the scroll wheel moves nicely and doesn't make any obnoxious noise. The only issue that I have is how loud the clicks are. It's not /that/ bad, but I was hoping for something a bit more quiet. It's not super obnoxious like most mice you'll come across, but it's still loud enough to draw your attention to it. Again, I'm a pretty relaxed gamer, so the games that I /do/ play don't require tremendous amounts of clicks, but if you're somebody that plays games that require more interaction and you don't personally like a \"clicky\" sounding mouse, this isn't for you.Overall though, this is a great mouse and the RGB lighting in my picture doesn't do it justice! The colors are beautiful and very vibrant (which I LOVE)! So I definitely recommend this mouse!"}

A big factor in my decision.- budget friendly and fairly responsive- sensor works well with fps games. Obviously not as good as G502, but I would argue for the average casual, it wouldn't matter. This does the job just fine. You will need a mousepad for this though.-  RGB is a plus. Pretty fun bonus. You can disable or customize it if you want.The only two things I would mention is that:a) Doesn't have very good grip to it due to the plastic feel. It's smooth all over.b) Would be nice if the clicks weren't as loud."}

If you're looking for the best bang for the buck and purchasing a new PC gaming set up, this would be the first mouse I recommend.  Also if you're a 3D artist and looking for a mouse with a nice scroll wheel button and scrolling mechanism that works wonderfully with all your 3D software packages, this is the mouse I'd recommend.  For the quality you get, I personally think its cheap and a great deal.  Now, having raved about how good of a deal it is, I'm not going to say it's as good as the Razer Viper Ultimate Wireless that I just recently purchased.  It just isn't that good.  The G203 is considerably heavier than the Viper Ultimate and I have come to really appreciate a lighter mouse.  However, the G203 is solidly built and I'm sure I'll be using the two that I have for several years because they are well built and durable.The DPI sensitivity can be turned up far higher than I would personally ever want (8000 DPI) and I doubt it will be a limiting factor for most people.  It has a 1000Hz pooling rate, which is a far higher refresh rate than any monitor I know of and I doubt you really need much more if any at all for the foreseeable future.  The shape of the body of the mouse is nice, after using the Viper Ultimate, I do wish the G203 was a bit shorter when measured rising up off the mousepad but seriously a minor gripe.  After using the Viper Ultimate, I do wish the backward and forward buttons on the side of the mouse were a bit bigger like the Viper Ultimate but they are workable. The lighting on the mouse is surprisingly pleasing a smooth.  From my experience the Logitech G Hub software is well designed at easy to use.  I heavily prefer G Hub compared to Razer Synapse.  Synapse so often requests log in credentials and it's a rage inducing pain, Logitech in contrast does it the correct way and does not require a log in at all.  You just have to install the software and that's it, it works and it doesn't take up too many system resources.  The cord of this mouse is a bit heavier than some and less flexible than some but it's not bad.  I highly recommend a mouse cord Bungee to go with this mouse, its a great combo if you'd rather not spend the extra coin on a wireless mouse and you can be highly competitive gaming with that set up.  I personally use this mouse with the Thermaltake Tt e SPORTS Galeru Bungee on my work machine and it's awesome.  I tend not to lug around a bungee in my backpack with my laptop but the G203 is my main laptop mouse and I do well in competitive games without the bungee also.This mouse is an easy recommendation for me, I think it's one of the best investments one can make as a PC gamer.  I would guess it's light years better than mice that are included with most if not all prebuilt PC's.  As a long time (25+ years) PC builder, enthusiast and gamer it's hard to put into words how impressive this one mouse is in terms of cost to performance ratio, it's a landmark in my mind.  It's the minimum and the maximum that I feel like you really need to be a strong competitive gamer, everything else is either that extra icing on the cake or the e-waste that will fill a landfills quickly in coming years.  Just my personal guess this mouse could last you 10 years and there wont be a major compelling reason to upgrade outside of weight during that time.  A slow transition to all USB-C maybe could happen and that might be a reason to get a new mouse but honestly this one I think will last you a while if you want it to."}

But minus 0.5 stars for stupid software = 4 stars.IN SHORT:  For the price point it's a slightly above-average daily or light gaming mouse, esp. if you want RGB lighting effects ON all the time. But the software needs to be simpler to use, and there's no mouse button to quickly toggle RGB on/off.FAIL:  Most RGB mice have a button you can hold down to turn RGB lighting On/Off -but NOT this Logitech one.  Instead, download and installation of special software (Logitech \"G Hub\"), and manual fiddling with the settings in that software is required to disable or adjust RGB.YAY:  MOUSE POLLING SPEED OPTIONS (Customizable):I do like the fact you can use the G Hub software to set 4 custom polling speeds on the mouse. I adjusted mine to 400 / 800 / 1200 / 1600.  Pressing the button next to the scroll wheel toggles through the polling speeds. I use 1200 for daily tasks, 1600 for fast games. Slower speeds like 400 or 800 can be useful for more precise mouse pointer movement, such as in some slower puzzle games.SIZE:The G203 mouse is medium/average size (which is fine unless you have very small or very large hands).  It's slightly smaller than the MSI or Corsair mice I typically use. It is lightweight and moves easily. If you have very long fingers, this mouse might be a tad too short for long gaming sessions, comfort-wise.

I've accidentally hit it while gaming when using the scroll wheel once-or-twice, but it's such a minor issue that I'm more than happy to hand-wave. It's a $30 mouse, and it's built better than some mice I've used that are 2x-3x more expensive."}

The shape of this mouse fits my hand well. It is similar to the old Logitech opticals. My other G203 mouse was compatible with the older Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) and the newer Logitech GHub software (GHub). LGS has less issues than GHub. The newer version (no difference in operation or features) is not compatible with LGS. Maybe it is the firmware. I haven't tried a downgrade. I got it programed and then uninstalled GHub. Onboard Memory Manager should also work. It recognized the mouse and I could program it but I had issues with button customization options. That might have been my fault."}

Also, I didn't install the software as I didn't want any additional bloat, but you will probably need it if you want more control of the colors and battery status etc. I have used it for a month or so to get a good feel for how it is.Now with that out of the way, some important things I wanted to mention about the mouse that weren't clear that might benefit others.- DPI or dots per inch affects the speed at which the mouse will move across the screen. If you are noticing very slow mouse movement (saw some reviews mention this), then increase the DPI and see if that gets you to something you like. The buttons are labeled in the manual. You can also try adjusting mouse speed in your OS (I'll leave that to you to figure out for your specific OS).- Report/polling rate affects the frequency at which the mouse communicates with the computer. In theory, the higher, the better accuracy, but also the greater drain on battery as it has to do more. Without the software, the rates correlate to color flashed on the scroll wheel when you set it using button on the bottom of the mouse. The rates allowed are 125 red/250 blue/500 green/1000Hz pink.Ok, so onto the pros:- Cost is fairly good. Considering you are getting a wireless mouse that can be plugged in and function as a wired mouse, it's fairly affordable.- Very accurate and I notice no lag with usage. I run at 250Hz poll rate (blue), though to be honest, I don't really notice any difference at 125Hz. Again, not gaming, so your mileage may vary, but give you can bump it up to 1000Hz, it should be adequate for most. I did confirm the poll rates online. You can google for sites that will report the detected poll rate of the mouse if you are interested in seeing it and from those sites, I did see the mouse was polling at the rates they claimed.- Rapid fire works as claimed and triggers 3 left mouse button clicks. I don't have a need for it so can't speak to how well it works in games or if the software allows any tuning of the rate at which it clicks 3 times, but there's no way to do it on the mouse itself.- Battery life is ok. I get roughly a week out of it using it for work. I have it on normal power on mode which means the LEDs are on so long as the mouse is actively getting used. I also use it on 250Hz polling for reference. LEDs go out after a minute and mouse goes to sleep after 5. The scroll wheel blinks red to let you know it is running low and will light up as stable green when fully charged (at least it is supposed to though it doesn't always do that but that may be related to the con listed later on about this).- Uses USB-C.- Wireless connectivity is stable. I use it 95% of the time wirelessly and only plug it in to charge and don't really notice any connectivity issues/lag.Cons:- It admittedly feels and looks cheap in some respects. The plastic feels very cheap. The scroll wheel looks probably the worst in that regards as just mostly plastic wheel that has a rubber tire or sorts on it. That said, the wheel feels and behaves fine for the most part and I care more about the function than the form so I don't necessarily care too much, but if you want something that looks premium, this probably won't do.- About that scroll wheel, it doesn't have horizontal tilt if you want to scroll left/right. That may or may not matter to you. For gaming, probably better it doesn't, but for normal work, I prefer having it so it was a bit of a let down for me.- LEDs are decent. They are RGB as you can see the same sections change color, unlike some that claim to be RGB but really only light up one color, but that said, you can see the individual sections. It doesn't look seamless as the colors transition down the mouse in some color modes making it very obvious where the different LED sections are. Probably would have required more LEDs to get the nicer affect, but it still looks fairly decent as a whole.- No way to keep the LEDs on. It turns off if it's idle and as I type most of the time rather than use the mouse, it is off a lot. For those who care about having it on all the time, just know that won't be possible.- Deep sleep after 5 mins is a huge annoyance. You have to scroll the wheel or click to re-wake it. While the other stuff I have listed is mostly superficial and I don't really mind at the end of the day, this 'feature' does bother me. I would prefer if it could wake on motion or something.- The charging/wire is a bit finnicky. I sometimes have to unplug and replug it multiple times for it to really make a good connection and get detected by the computer/charge. At first I thought I just wasn't seating it in all the way, but that was definitely not the issue. It also seems that it prefers having the plug go in with the cable flipped in a specific direction. Given this is USB-C and you shouldn't have to care which way it plugs in, so it adds to the cheap feel of the product. I might have gotten a defective component or something here, so you may have better luck with this. While annoying, it is still overall functional and not worth the headache of an exchange for me. I just put some tape on the usb cable to indicate the side it wants up and it works most of the time now when I plug it in that way. This alone probably cost it a star.- Ergonomics are a bit average for me, but that is hugely personal preference and depends on your anatomy so it's hard to knock it for that too much. I prefer a slight slant to the mouse with the left button a bit higher than the right to allow me wrist to rest in a more comfortable position, but that's not for everyone.Overall, for the price, you get a decent mouse. Most of the cons again are rather superficial, but if you are getting something like this with LEDs etc, the look and feel is what you are getting it for so the fact that it looks and feel slightly on the cheap side is a bit of a let down. I wouldn't discourage buying it necessarily for just that (probably docked it 1 start just for those things combined), and given a choice, I'd buy this mouse again if those were the only issues, but I get it if that is enough to make you say no. The bigger issue for me is the poor usb-c connection/port and the lack of wake up on motion.Hopefully this review helps you."}

I was hesitant to get it because I was worried the charging would be an ordeal, but the battery life lasts forever. When it first came, I'm assuming it arrived fully charged which was great. I'd say it lasted near a week out of the box before I had to charge it. I've only had to charge it a few times since I've gotten it and you dont even have to charge it for very long. The only things I would criticize is that it feels a bit cheap, at least compared to my old mouse. It's very light feeling, and its easy to bend the plastic as when it arrived the clicker part was bent up onto the packaging and I thought it was broken. It was not broken, it snapped right back in place but I feel like that's worth mentioning if you're looking for something more heavy. The settings and colors are nice, the LEDS aren't consistent looking, I can see where they're placed but it doesn't bother me too much, it still lights up. overall it's a perfectly decent mouse and I'm satisfied given the price."}

I was hesitant to get it because I was worried the charging would be an ordeal, but the battery life lasts forever. When it first came, I'm assuming it arrived fully charged which was great. I'd say it lasted near a week out of the box before I had to charge it. I've only had to charge it a few times since I've gotten it and you dont even have to charge it for very long. The only things I would criticize is that it feels a bit cheap, at least compared to my old mouse. It's very light feeling, and its easy to bend the plastic as when it arrived the clicker part was bent up onto the packaging and I thought it was broken. It was not broken, it snapped right back in place but I feel like that's worth mentioning if you're looking for something more heavy. The settings and colors are nice, the LEDS aren't consistent looking, I can see where they're placed but it doesn't bother me too much, it still lights up. overall it's a perfectly decent mouse and I'm satisfied given the price."}

I don't mind that it sleeps but I would like to have a wake on motion function instead of a button click, which can affect your position depending on where that cursor happens to be when you click one of the three wake buttons.

I am normally picky about mouses but I would settle for this if I didn't have any other options. It does the job.- main complaint is with the battery life and the charging port. Battery seems to go by fast even with a low light setting and the 'eco' mode on. Charging port at the front of the mouse is USB C which is nice BUT the hole for the port has some depth to it, so basically if the plastic shield around your usb c cable is too thick it wont fit. This seems to happen with a variety of usb c cables I own, which makes using the mouse while charging slightly impossible because the cable barley fits. These cables I own aren't like weird off brand cables either. They are cables from anker, xbox, 8 bitdo etc. and they have a pretty standard size of shielding around the cables. They give you a cable, but I think for some reason I needed a even longer one hence why I didn't use their provided cable which worked fine."}

I had two problems, one I fixed the other I found a work-around. I'm not a gamer, I'm a programmer. I reprogram the buttons to make programming faster.First problem: the mouse goes to sleep after some time of non-use. It seems that the only way to wake it is to click the left or right buttons. Those clicks are then sent to whatever app you happen to be on when it went to sleep. I could not find a way to disable this, or a different way to wake it up. But I did find that if you leave it connected to the USB port it does not go to sleep. Wireless is no big deal to me, so wired it is.Second problem: I wanted to pause VLC with a button press but I couldn't see how to do this. Here is how I solved this: first, reprogram the button on the mouse to 'Media Pause'. Second, in VLC go to Preferences->Hotkeys. In the 'Play/Pause' action click in the 'Global' column then click the button you programmed on the mouse. That will set the 'Media Play Pause' into the Global setting. Then restart VLC."}

I like that it has a thumb rest and small movements could be made quickly and accurately.  I have a US mens size 8 hand, and use the claw grip.  Every once in a while the sniper button is handy, but I never use the other 2 side buttons.I hated having to configure the thing on WinBlows, then using the \"profile\" button to change mouse modes on Linux.  Now openrazer and Polychromatic work well on Linux with the v1, v2 and v3 models.  No need for the \"profile\" button, but I do use the two little buttons below the scroll wheel to change sensitivity now and again.The v2 added left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, and a manual friction adjustment on the scroll wheel.  I never use the tilt, but getting the scroll wheel friction just right is very nice.Then I bought this v3.  One step forward, one step back.  The friction adjustment is gone, and 3 months later I still miss it.  I now use the \"smart wheel\" mode, and 3 months later it still surprises me.  I can sort of predict when the wheel friction will go away and infinite scroll mode starts.  After a bit, the scroll wheel friction comes back with a little click, but the infinite scroll mode stays on.  If I move the mouse to another window then, the window will also infinite scroll, and that is never what I want.  Some indeterminate time later, the infinite scroll turns off, with no indication that has happened.The infinite scroll mode is really useful for many web pages, but too hard to use most of the time.Given the choice, I might buy a v2 instead of the v3 next time.  I hope for a v4 which fixes the problems with the new free scroll mode."}

I am an everyday computer user (actually an IT retiree). I absolutely love this mouse for everyday desk work! It's so responsive and pretty and eye-catching. Everyone comments and inquires about it.  I followed the instructions for setup then configured a couple of settings after watching some online videos. I wanted a solid, good replacement for my old Microsoft mice that have gotten incrementally \"tired\" over years and years of use. Success found with this mouse.In case you're wondering about the configurations, there's a ton of them. I kept it really simple and used mostly the defaults. The most fun setting are the light options--super cool! Mine is set to cycle thru the entire color palette. So nice to have something whimsical on the desk.If you're curious, I still use the built-in Windows 10 mouse control settings thru the System settings to control this fancy-pants mouse. I set the blink rate for insertion point, click rates, etc.  I do NOT have the Razer application(s) running via the System Tray (turn them off thru Task Manager / Startup). I can activate the apps any time via the Start Menu / Razer folder. I DO recommend setting up a Razer profile, but you don't have to stay logged in. If I recall, I setup my profile to register my mouse (Razer Basilisk v3).To give the fancy mouse a nice parking spot, I bought a new (gaming) mouse pad, roughly 8\"x10\". It's totally not necessary, but the new pad makes the mouse space look fresh. (Machine washing my old mouse pad does the same, but I digress.)If you're tired of mini-mice and unresponsive mice and boring mice, I encourage this one be put to task.

Now openrazer and Polychromatic work well on Linux with the v1, v2 and v3 models.  No need for the \"profile\" button, but I do use the two little buttons below the scroll wheel to change sensitivity now and again.The v2 added left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, and a manual friction adjustment on the scroll wheel.  I never use the tilt, but getting the scroll wheel friction just right is very nice.Then I bought this v3.  One step forward, one step back.  The friction adjustment is gone, and 3 months later I still miss it.  I now use the \"smart wheel\" mode, and 3 months later it still surprises me.  I can sort of predict when the wheel friction will go away and infinite scroll mode starts.  After a bit, the scroll wheel friction comes back with a little click, but the infinite scroll mode stays on.  If I move the mouse to another window then, the window will also infinite scroll, and that is never what I want.  Some indeterminate time later, the infinite scroll turns off, with no indication that has happened.The infinite scroll mode is really useful for many web pages, but too hard to use most of the time.Given the choice, I might buy a v2 instead of the v3 next time.

I like that it has a thumb rest and small movements could be made quickly and accurately.  I have a US mens size 8 hand, and use the claw grip.  Every once in a while the sniper button is handy, but I never use the other 2 side buttons.I hated having to configure the thing on WinBlows, then using the \"profile\" button to change mouse modes on Linux.  Now openrazer and Polychromatic work well on Linux with the v1, v2 and v3 models.  No need for the \"profile\" button, but I do use the two little buttons below the scroll wheel to change sensitivity now and again.The v2 added left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, and a manual friction adjustment on the scroll wheel.  I never use the tilt, but getting the scroll wheel friction just right is very nice.Then I bought this v3.  One step forward, one step back.  The friction adjustment is gone, and 3 months later I still miss it.  I now use the \"smart wheel\" mode, and 3 months later it still surprises me.  I can sort of predict when the wheel friction will go away and infinite scroll mode starts.  After a bit, the scroll wheel friction comes back with a little click, but the infinite scroll mode stays on.  If I move the mouse to another window then, the window will also infinite scroll, and that is never what I want.  Some indeterminate time later, the infinite scroll turns off, with no indication that has happened.The infinite scroll mode is really useful for many web pages, but too hard to use most of the time.Given the choice, I might buy a v2 instead of the v3 next time.  I hope for a v4 which fixes the problems with the new free scroll mode."}

I am an everyday computer user (actually an IT retiree). I absolutely love this mouse for everyday desk work! It's so responsive and pretty and eye-catching. Everyone comments and inquires about it.  I followed the instructions for setup then configured a couple of settings after watching some online videos. I wanted a solid, good replacement for my old Microsoft mice that have gotten incrementally \"tired\" over years and years of use. Success found with this mouse.In case you're wondering about the configurations, there's a ton of them. I kept it really simple and used mostly the defaults. The most fun setting are the light options--super cool! Mine is set to cycle thru the entire color palette. So nice to have something whimsical on the desk.If you're curious, I still use the built-in Windows 10 mouse control settings thru the System settings to control this fancy-pants mouse. I set the blink rate for insertion point, click rates, etc.  I do NOT have the Razer application(s) running via the System Tray (turn them off thru Task Manager / Startup). I can activate the apps any time via the Start Menu / Razer folder. I DO recommend setting up a Razer profile, but you don't have to stay logged in. If I recall, I setup my profile to register my mouse (Razer Basilisk v3).To give the fancy mouse a nice parking spot, I bought a new (gaming) mouse pad, roughly 8\"x10\". It's totally not necessary, but the new pad makes the mouse space look fresh. (Machine washing my old mouse pad does the same, but I digress.)If you're tired of mini-mice and unresponsive mice and boring mice, I encourage this one be put to task. From its quality feel and look, and its impressive ergonomic design, I'll be enjoying it for years ahead."}

My only real complaint is the design of the scroll wheel, which I just do not understand. It worked well for about a year and a half, but around the 18-month mark the wheel started \"slipping\". It wasn't like a problem with the sensors(as the razer website will tell you), it was almost like the rubber grip was sliding without turning the wheel. It didn't happen all the time, just on occasion I'd miss a few clicks when scrolling. Not a problem for browsing the internet, a bit of a problem for gaming. When I went to try to figure out what was wrong, I realized that the rubber grip on the wheel is literally just a ring of rubber, completely smooth and flat on the bottom. It's just sitting on a band of smooth metal. The metal is completely clean, as is the underside of the rubber, leading me to believe that there wasn't even any adhesive. They just put a smooth rubber band on smooth metal and.... hoped for the best? I just don't get it. I guess the friction from how tight the band was worked for a bit, but obviously, with time, the rubber has relaxed slightly. It doesn't take much for smooth rubber to slip on smooth metal. I mean, I can't be that mad because it was a fairly cheap mouse that's been pretty high quality, I just don't get why a bit of adhesive or a rough surface was not considered. Seems like a huge oversight, and not an especially expensive design change."}

My only real complaint is the design of the scroll wheel, which I just do not understand. It worked well for about a year and a half, but around the 18-month mark the wheel started \"slipping\". It wasn't like a problem with the sensors(as the razer website will tell you), it was almost like the rubber grip was sliding without turning the wheel. It didn't happen all the time, just on occasion I'd miss a few clicks when scrolling. Not a problem for browsing the internet, a bit of a problem for gaming. When I went to try to figure out what was wrong, I realized that the rubber grip on the wheel is literally just a ring of rubber, completely smooth and flat on the bottom. It's just sitting on a band of smooth metal. The metal is completely clean, as is the underside of the rubber, leading me to believe that there wasn't even any adhesive. They just put a smooth rubber band on smooth metal and.... hoped for the best? I just don't get it. I guess the friction from how tight the band was worked for a bit, but obviously, with time, the rubber has relaxed slightly. It doesn't take much for smooth rubber to slip on smooth metal. I mean, I can't be that mad because it was a fairly cheap mouse that's been pretty high quality, I just don't get why a bit of adhesive or a rough surface was not considered. Seems like a huge oversight, and not an especially expensive design change."}

I've owned many Logitech and Razer mouses that have cost 2-4 times what this mouse does, and none of them have been any better. In fact, I've never had any mouse last more than 2 years without developing some sort of problem needing a replacement mouse. This can get expensive. I've only had this one for a couple weeks, but if it lasts a year, it was money well spent.The good.Tracks perfectly. Very comfortable. Many buttons. Wired and wireless. Adjustable DPI. Easy to use macro software. RGB can be turned off or customized. All the buttons are recognized by Windows out of the box. The 1-12 buttons are programmed as keyboard 1-9, 0, and +, -. The extra front button is programmed as a triple left click. This makes it easy to assign keybinds in games without using macros.The bad.The twelve side buttons are small. The sensor prefers a mouse pad, and it stutters on my bare desk surface. Some people complain about the macro software, but it's similar to any other, and easy to use. Some people complain about no Bluetooth, but the 2.4 ghz works perfectly in my setup. When switching from wired to wireless (by unplugging the USBC) it takes several seconds to restablish a connection. Some say it's hard to pick up to recenter the cursor, but that has not been the case for me.Overall.This is an outstanding mouse, especially at the price point. I would certainly buy it again. However, after some use, I would maybe prefer the version that only has 8 side buttons (plus forward and back buttons).  My only gripe is that the 12 side buttons are small and hard to orient my tumb on the desired button without glancing at the mouse first. The model with 8 side buttons looks a little easier to navigate as the buttons are more spaced apart. Ignore the comments about the macro software. It's easy to use if you've ever programmed macros before. Even if you haven't, there are short YouTube videos that walk you through the process if you need them.If you want a multi button, multi function, high DPI, programmable gaming mouse at a great price, this is it. No regrets."}

It has quite a few keyboard shortcuts for moving/placing/replacing objects and I've started hating the whole Press-shift, Press Ctrl-F, Press W/E/T and whatever!  So I figured I'd give a programmable mouse a try.  I didn't want to spend too much since I'll probably lose interest in the Creation Kit in about a week anyway. :P  For only $22 on sale it was a pretty easy decision.Mouse came in a nice little solid plastic container which seems like overkill for such a cheap mouse, but whatever.  Mouse itself is pretty solid.  Side buttons are a little small, but I think I can get used to them.  Cord is very soft an pliable which is nice.  Unit came with little weights that can be swapped in and out to adjust the weight.  Though I'm a gamer, I've always thought these weights were a little gimmicky since they don't appreciably change the feel (at least not to me.)  All in all, the mouse seems pretty nice.  The only slight issue I've had is the lack of documentation.  The little tiny booklet that comes with it is kinda useless so I went to the website.  Turns out the same thing is available on the website but in a PDF format so no joy there either.  Luckily I'm a pretty nerdy dude so I soldiered on. :)  After finding and installing the software I fired everything up.  The software was a little less than intuitive, but again, with a little effort you can get it figured out.  The great news is, for a mere $22 you can make software that has lots of frequently used keyboard shortcuts MUCH easier to use.  After getting everything set up I was much more productive after a short time getting used to the button mapping(s).  You can also change the lighting and effects easily through the software and export your profiles so you can use them on other machines (my laptop for instance) without having to remap all the keys.  I haven't tried that just yet, but I'm imaging it'll work fine.  All in all, if your noodling it, just buy one.  :)"}

It is a great purchase.  The customization for this thing is something I never would have thought I would see in a mouse.  You can put macros on your buttons, you can change the lighting to any possibility available, you can change what the mouse buttons actually do, and you can add or remove weights to this mouse to get yourself a better and more personal feel.  I really do love this thing.My rating is 4/5 instead of 5/5 because the right click is already failing me.  I have not had this thing a whole year yet but the right click is to the point to where I either have to tap it several times in advance to make sure it is ready to use or I have to contort my fingers to reach the further back on the mouse so that it activates.  I know this is not correct and not due to usage because the left click has seen way more usage and still works perfectly.  This thing has damn near 20 different buttons and they all function properly except the right click!  It is like there is something stuck in it that has to be pushed out the way.  I cleaned the mouse, sprayed it out with compressed air, opened and inspected it, and I connect find a reason why it is this way.  I have other RedDragon mice and they all work perfectly.  This one started to act crazy after about 3 months.  I contacted RedDragon and am going to see how their warranty works out.  If I can get it repaired or replaced, I'll update this review with the results.Right click aside, this is still a terrific mouse.  Even if I knew I'd get this right click problem I'd still buy it just for the usefulness and customization this mouse offers.  A great product, great idea, and great execution.------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEAfter submitting a request to Redragon and talking to support, I was able to get the problem fixed.  It was just a small piece under the right click that had slipped out of place.  Once I took it off and placed it back on, it worked just like new!  I am not even sure how I missed that but I am super glad I don't have to send my mouse off or order a new one.  A+ customer service and product.  Just ordered a mechanical keyboard from them and I think I'm a fanboy now."}

But... every now and then I'd play a game that I just really needed some sorta hotkey or macro thing but it was too annoying to have to bind and rebind the mouse buttons or rebind all my keys just to have to rebind them again after reinstalling or I couldn't hecking remember what I even mapped everything to the very next day.I was a fool. I'm never getting a normal mouse ever again.Pros- I'm a big boy so the total 0.04lbs(19.5g) the weights add don't really help all that much but it has given me an idea to jerryrig it with some heavier metals. Very good idea overall. Makes you shooty real good.- I love multiple dpi levels so having FIVE different ones is amazing. Sometimes a game thinks 800 DPI means you should whip across the screen just by breathing but with this instead of fumbling in the settings for twenty minutes I can just lower my DPI.- As edgy and somewhat confusing as the program is for this mouse, it's very very helpful and can even bind macros and use the F13-F24 keys.- The gratuitous amount of buttons are wonderful, if there's any extra amount of nonsense an MMO tries demanding I press, I just bind those to the side of the mouse. I missed my back and forward buttons but I just bound those to 1 and 4 and problem solved.- There are multiple profiles that you can even swap to with one of the macros for those of course that play many many games and wish to have a profile for each game or each class yadda yadda.- It is 100% fully customizable, even the mouse buttons can be changed. You can rebind left click, you can rebind right click, middle click, scroll wheel, and if you don't swap between DPI at all you can even rebind the dpi buttons to do something else.- It's got gamer stickers for your PC tower or whatever if you're a weirdo who needs those.- This thing comes in an adorable little carepackage case lookin' thing. Even the weights have a tiny case.- RGB go brr. (Very customizable for any setup.)Cons- Nothing tells you where to download the fricken fracken software. I just googled red dragon software (which is not what this is) then proceeded to google \"redragon\" software and found it that way.- The program for this mouse as mentioned before is somewhat confusing.- This could entirely be because I am stupid but I thought auto-fire meant rapid fire. At first it didn't seem to fire or automatically do so either. Upon further testing it does more of a burst fire sorta thing. I thought I was supposed to just hold it down and it'd rapid fire but I guess not. This can be adjusted to fire more than a few times and adjust the \"delay\" but setting the delay to 0 doesn't do squat.- Maybe my hands are just a bit big but this ergonomic mouse doesn't feel very ergonomic. I've since just put my hand on it at an angle and it feels better but I can tell that's not the way it was designed."}

I bought it to replace my old, wired Redragon MMO mouse. The old mouse in question is still fully functional, and the only reason it was replaced was because I wanted something newer (in terms of appearance), and wireless.The fact the my older Redragon mouse lasted so long (over 8 years, and still going) is what compelled me to seek out Redragon yet again for a new mouse. The other deciding factor were the side buttons. Many other MMO mice that I've used, whilst having great ergonomics, all seem to have the same issue: the buttons are WAY too sensitive. With the M913, I do not have this issue. The side buttons on the M913 are just the right amount of rigid where I don't accidentally press them in the heat of the moment (I'm an anxious wreck and tend to clamp my hand during stressful scenarios).I'll keep it brief with the Pros and Cons:PROS:- Build Quality- Battery Life- Aesthetics- RGB- Wireless- PriceCONS:- Software (Not the worst, but far from the best)- Gloss Finish (the side grips are absolute fingerprint magnets)I've decided to give a full five-star rating, as the pros far outweigh the cons and there is nothing about this mouse that I find lacking in terms of functionality."}

Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.  Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Button click quality is similar.

Changing batteries is annoying, but rarely needed.  For me the wire is fine on the desk, but on-the-go users will like the Logitech better.Logitech also has a sensor/bluetooth switch, allowing for use on two different computers.  Redragon is plug-and-play on one computer at a time, but does a better job at on-boarding macros.Logitech has the fly-wheel scrolling.  As nice as it is, it's not really noticable when you don't have the option.  Unless you access a huge table to scroll through...  Logitech also has left/right switches on the wheel, which I found annoying.Logitech has major double click issues.  Tried on two mice and changed the switch, still problems.  Those started about 9-12 months into using the mouse, so too early to compare to Redragon but it turned me off Logitech.SIMILARITIESThe sensors feel about equal.

But that alone doesn't justify the very high price compared to the Redragon.  If the Redragon doesn't suffer the same double-click issues after a year, then I'll easily prefer the wired solution than the double-click frustrations.  Time will tell though.  I'll vote 5*, easily will buy Redragon again after this, no more Logitech."}

I've owned many Logitech and Razer mouses that have cost 2-4 times what this mouse does, and none of them have been any better. In fact, I've never had any mouse last more than 2 years without developing some sort of problem needing a replacement mouse. This can get expensive. I've only had this one for a couple weeks, but if it lasts a year, it was money well spent.The good.Tracks perfectly. Very comfortable. Many buttons. Wired and wireless. Adjustable DPI. Easy to use macro software. RGB can be turned off or customized. All the buttons are recognized by Windows out of the box. The 1-12 buttons are programmed as keyboard 1-9, 0, and +, -. The extra front button is programmed as a triple left click. This makes it easy to assign keybinds in games without using macros.The bad.The twelve side buttons are small. The sensor prefers a mouse pad, and it stutters on my bare desk surface. Some people complain about the macro software, but it's similar to any other, and easy to use. Some people complain about no Bluetooth, but the 2.4 ghz works perfectly in my setup. When switching from wired to wireless (by unplugging the USBC) it takes several seconds to restablish a connection. Some say it's hard to pick up to recenter the cursor, but that has not been the case for me.Overall.This is an outstanding mouse, especially at the price point. I would certainly buy it again. However, after some use, I would maybe prefer the version that only has 8 side buttons (plus forward and back buttons).  My only gripe is that the 12 side buttons are small and hard to orient my tumb on the desired button without glancing at the mouse first. The model with 8 side buttons looks a little easier to navigate as the buttons are more spaced apart. Ignore the comments about the macro software. It's easy to use if you've ever programmed macros before. Even if you haven't, there are short YouTube videos that walk you through the process if you need them.If you want a multi button, multi function, high DPI, programmable gaming mouse at a great price, this is it. No regrets."}

It has quite a few keyboard shortcuts for moving/placing/replacing objects and I've started hating the whole Press-shift, Press Ctrl-F, Press W/E/T and whatever!  So I figured I'd give a programmable mouse a try.  I didn't want to spend too much since I'll probably lose interest in the Creation Kit in about a week anyway. :P  For only $22 on sale it was a pretty easy decision.Mouse came in a nice little solid plastic container which seems like overkill for such a cheap mouse, but whatever.  Mouse itself is pretty solid.  Side buttons are a little small, but I think I can get used to them.  Cord is very soft an pliable which is nice.  Unit came with little weights that can be swapped in and out to adjust the weight.  Though I'm a gamer, I've always thought these weights were a little gimmicky since they don't appreciably change the feel (at least not to me.)  All in all, the mouse seems pretty nice.  The only slight issue I've had is the lack of documentation.  The little tiny booklet that comes with it is kinda useless so I went to the website.  Turns out the same thing is available on the website but in a PDF format so no joy there either.  Luckily I'm a pretty nerdy dude so I soldiered on. :)  After finding and installing the software I fired everything up.  The software was a little less than intuitive, but again, with a little effort you can get it figured out.  The great news is, for a mere $22 you can make software that has lots of frequently used keyboard shortcuts MUCH easier to use.  After getting everything set up I was much more productive after a short time getting used to the button mapping(s).  You can also change the lighting and effects easily through the software and export your profiles so you can use them on other machines (my laptop for instance) without having to remap all the keys.  I haven't tried that just yet, but I'm imaging it'll work fine.  All in all, if your noodling it, just buy one.  :)"}

It is a great purchase.  The customization for this thing is something I never would have thought I would see in a mouse.  You can put macros on your buttons, you can change the lighting to any possibility available, you can change what the mouse buttons actually do, and you can add or remove weights to this mouse to get yourself a better and more personal feel.  I really do love this thing.My rating is 4/5 instead of 5/5 because the right click is already failing me.  I have not had this thing a whole year yet but the right click is to the point to where I either have to tap it several times in advance to make sure it is ready to use or I have to contort my fingers to reach the further back on the mouse so that it activates.  I know this is not correct and not due to usage because the left click has seen way more usage and still works perfectly.  This thing has damn near 20 different buttons and they all function properly except the right click!  It is like there is something stuck in it that has to be pushed out the way.  I cleaned the mouse, sprayed it out with compressed air, opened and inspected it, and I connect find a reason why it is this way.  I have other RedDragon mice and they all work perfectly.  This one started to act crazy after about 3 months.  I contacted RedDragon and am going to see how their warranty works out.  If I can get it repaired or replaced, I'll update this review with the results.Right click aside, this is still a terrific mouse.  Even if I knew I'd get this right click problem I'd still buy it just for the usefulness and customization this mouse offers.  A great product, great idea, and great execution.------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEAfter submitting a request to Redragon and talking to support, I was able to get the problem fixed.  It was just a small piece under the right click that had slipped out of place.  Once I took it off and placed it back on, it worked just like new!  I am not even sure how I missed that but I am super glad I don't have to send my mouse off or order a new one.  A+ customer service and product.  Just ordered a mechanical keyboard from them and I think I'm a fanboy now."}

But... every now and then I'd play a game that I just really needed some sorta hotkey or macro thing but it was too annoying to have to bind and rebind the mouse buttons or rebind all my keys just to have to rebind them again after reinstalling or I couldn't hecking remember what I even mapped everything to the very next day.I was a fool. I'm never getting a normal mouse ever again.Pros- I'm a big boy so the total 0.04lbs(19.5g) the weights add don't really help all that much but it has given me an idea to jerryrig it with some heavier metals. Very good idea overall. Makes you shooty real good.- I love multiple dpi levels so having FIVE different ones is amazing. Sometimes a game thinks 800 DPI means you should whip across the screen just by breathing but with this instead of fumbling in the settings for twenty minutes I can just lower my DPI.- As edgy and somewhat confusing as the program is for this mouse, it's very very helpful and can even bind macros and use the F13-F24 keys.- The gratuitous amount of buttons are wonderful, if there's any extra amount of nonsense an MMO tries demanding I press, I just bind those to the side of the mouse. I missed my back and forward buttons but I just bound those to 1 and 4 and problem solved.- There are multiple profiles that you can even swap to with one of the macros for those of course that play many many games and wish to have a profile for each game or each class yadda yadda.- It is 100% fully customizable, even the mouse buttons can be changed. You can rebind left click, you can rebind right click, middle click, scroll wheel, and if you don't swap between DPI at all you can even rebind the dpi buttons to do something else.- It's got gamer stickers for your PC tower or whatever if you're a weirdo who needs those.- This thing comes in an adorable little carepackage case lookin' thing. Even the weights have a tiny case.- RGB go brr. (Very customizable for any setup.)Cons- Nothing tells you where to download the fricken fracken software. I just googled red dragon software (which is not what this is) then proceeded to google \"redragon\" software and found it that way.- The program for this mouse as mentioned before is somewhat confusing.- This could entirely be because I am stupid but I thought auto-fire meant rapid fire. At first it didn't seem to fire or automatically do so either. Upon further testing it does more of a burst fire sorta thing. I thought I was supposed to just hold it down and it'd rapid fire but I guess not. This can be adjusted to fire more than a few times and adjust the \"delay\" but setting the delay to 0 doesn't do squat.- Maybe my hands are just a bit big but this ergonomic mouse doesn't feel very ergonomic. I've since just put my hand on it at an angle and it feels better but I can tell that's not the way it was designed."}

I bought it to replace my old, wired Redragon MMO mouse. The old mouse in question is still fully functional, and the only reason it was replaced was because I wanted something newer (in terms of appearance), and wireless.The fact the my older Redragon mouse lasted so long (over 8 years, and still going) is what compelled me to seek out Redragon yet again for a new mouse. The other deciding factor were the side buttons. Many other MMO mice that I've used, whilst having great ergonomics, all seem to have the same issue: the buttons are WAY too sensitive. With the M913, I do not have this issue. The side buttons on the M913 are just the right amount of rigid where I don't accidentally press them in the heat of the moment (I'm an anxious wreck and tend to clamp my hand during stressful scenarios).I'll keep it brief with the Pros and Cons:PROS:- Build Quality- Battery Life- Aesthetics- RGB- Wireless- PriceCONS:- Software (Not the worst, but far from the best)- Gloss Finish (the side grips are absolute fingerprint magnets)I've decided to give a full five-star rating, as the pros far outweigh the cons and there is nothing about this mouse that I find lacking in terms of functionality."}

I use the mouse for gaming/office, but I'm no pro gamer.The sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.  Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Button click quality is similar.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Switched from Logitech G604 (3 years) to Redragon M908 (2 months)DIFFERENCESRedragon is wired.  Changing batteries is annoying, but rarely needed.  For me the wire is fine on the desk, but on-the-go users will like the Logitech better.Logitech also has a sensor/bluetooth switch, allowing for use on two different computers.  Redragon is plug-and-play on one computer at a time, but does a better job at on-boarding macros.Logitech has the fly-wheel scrolling.  As nice as it is, it's not really noticable when you don't have the option.  Unless you access a huge table to scroll through...  Logitech also has left/right switches on the wheel, which I found annoying.Logitech has major double click issues.  Tried on two mice and changed the switch, still problems.  Those started about 9-12 months into using the mouse, so too early to compare to Redragon but it turned me off Logitech.SIMILARITIESThe sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.

Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.CONCLUSIONLogitech's only true strength was the 2-computer wireless feature.  But that alone doesn't justify the very high price compared to the Redragon.  If the Redragon doesn't suffer the same double-click issues after a year, then I'll easily prefer the wired solution than the double-click frustrations.  Time will tell though.  I'll vote 5*, easily will buy Redragon again after this, no more Logitech."}

I was using a razer naga for a while, but it ended up losing functionality in some of the buttons on the side.  So I got this thing and will not be going back to Razer.  It is far cheaper and better made.  I don't understand the weights inside of it, but some people are weird about their gaming things, so I guess its good to have the ability to customize the weight?If you are a gamer with limited mobility in your hands, short fingers, or have arthritis, I highly recommend a mouse like this one.  It makes gaming fun rather than painful and frustrating.  It takes time to get used to, but put in the effort to learn and it is FAR better on your hands than standard keybinds on a keyboard."}

I've had 2 of them for a year. One at work and one on my gaming laptop. The 12 button number pad is super useful.

I do use a clipboard app for scripts and stuff, but there are a few I'd like to have at a single button push. At first I thought the battery life was bad, because they would only last a few days between charges, but I realized the lights use a ton of battery and I really don't care about them most of the time. In Eco mode, this mouse lasts a month or two between charges, maybe more I don't really keep track but definitely more than a month of 8-hour-a-day use."}

Great customer service, and the mouse itself is very comfortable for medium to large hands.  (Very large hands may find it a bit small though).Note - you will need to download their software if you want to re-bind the mouse buttons.  The top 2 buttons near the scroll wheel are default set to change mouse sensitivity.  This is great if you play multiple games with different sensitivity preferences, but otherwise it's just a pain because you'll accidentally change the sensitivity a lot.  If I could change one thing it would be to remove that default binding out of the box, but it's easy enough to remove in the software."}

The 12 thumb buttons are wonderful when gaming, and even use them sometimes for regular tasks like my PC calculator and such.

I keep most of my abilities ready to fire using 1-12, shift+1-12, ctrl+1-12, and alt+1-12.  It took a bit to get used to but I quickly got adapted to it and it became natural.  Over the years I've continued to modify my in-game toolbar and optimize over time very intuitively.  Even if you're more casual this is easy to use and very fun.  I've now also obtained a wireless one of the same mouse (been using a different brand with my laptop), and am very excited now.  Was planning to use the new wireless one on my desktop, but I'll probably keep running this one on my desktop and the new wireless model for the laptop, it's just so ergonomic with the extension for the ring and pinky fingers compared to my old wireless."}

Now that I have gotten used to this mouse, the weight is perfect.  Remember, I was coming from a very heavy R.A.T. 7 mouse that made me feel a bit shocked by how light this one is.  This mouse feels great and, not that the mouse is the ONLY reason, but I did manage to get from Silver Elite Master to DMG on CS:GO playing with this mouse and will not doubt hit The Global Elite down the road a bit.  The mouse is very \"grippy\" in my hands and this is very important, for instance, when you are zoomed in with a sniper rifle awaiting an enemy coming into your view from around a door or corner.  Using more of a claw grip in these instances allows me a ridiculous amount of control over my crosshair movement (in other words, I can accurately move the mouse just a sliver in any given direction).  A big part of this is probably due to the quality of the laser mouse in combination with my sensitivity settings (which for CS:GO are: 1.5 sensitivity, 0.80 scoped in sensitivity, Raw Input = on, and my Windows sensitivity is on the middle tick mark with acceleration off).The buttons have held up superbly.  They are still very responsive, especially with their \"clicky\" feedback.  Of special note is the mouse wheel.  The rubber \"tire\" like covering on it works great and the down-click motion is direct and not sloppy.  You know how some mouses, when you try to click the middle-mouse button, cause you to slip off the wheel or not be able to click it effortlessly?  I haven't ran into that issue yet with this mouse.Still happy with this purchase and I really cannot find a reason NOT to give it 5 stars.  It looks cool, functions great, and has had very little issues.With that said, I am giving it 4 stars due to a driver issue and computer sleep mode issue.  Whenever I put my computer to sleep and then wake it back up, I have to unplug and then re-plug the mouse to get Windows to recognize it.  I Googled this issue and nothing that would indicate it being anything else but this mouse.  My other mice don't have that issue and neither do my other USB devices.Also, I downloaded a driver/software for this mouse from the manufacturer's web site (if I recall correctly) and this caused my mouse to randomly click every few minutes.  During a match in CS:GO, you could imagine how this could really mess things up (sniping, defusing a bomb, maintaining stealth, having a grenade out).  After uninstalling the software, the mouse went back to normal.GET THIS MOUSE!  It really is an amazing value and I'd pay more than I did for it.  I got this for about $17 with Prime shipping.  I would easily have paid $25-30 knowing what I do now.***END UPDATE***Appearance:This mouse looks great, in my opinion.  It has a very aggressive look, and the pairing of a red and black color scheme is a nice touch.  The color LEDs appear on the back of the mouse and both sides which add a very coll effect.  Additionally, the side thumb buttons and the thumb rest are textured and/or slotted for design and grip.  SCORE: 9/10 for appearance.Build quality:So far, the mouse is holding up well.  There is a non-rubberized coating that is more like a matte finish on the main body of the mouse.  This seems to be slip resistant and helps with grip.  The buttons are very \"clicky\" which is great.  I play CS:GO a lot, and I had an issue with my R.A.T. 7 where it felt as if some of the buttons were a bit mushy.  I immediately noticed the difference with the buttons of this mouse and love the switches that the buttons use.  The mouse, overall, feels like it will hold up structurally for some time, and all of the pieces look well-finished and put together.  The braided cable tells me they went the extra mile to make sure this mouse delivers.  SCORE: 9/10Feel:This is the big category for me.  The mouse feels very light, even with the weights inserted into the chassis.  It feels light enough that I almost wish it were just a tad bit heavier, but this could merely be just personal preference.  One other complain I have is the feel of the thumb rest.  It is a piece of textured plastic (which seems like good quality nonetheless).  My gripe is that it would be nice to have something a little \"grippier\" or \"rubbery\" there to make my thumb feel a little more like part of the mouse.  Although, I must say that I enjoy the slotted thumb rest and it seems to help with keeping my hand/thumb cooler.The buttons feel great and responsive.  Not spongy at all.  I love the crisp \"click\" that this mouse has on all of the buttons.  There is only one button to change the sensitivity, so it would have been nice to have another one to change it the opposite way.  In CS:GO, I like to down my sensitivity depending on what weapon I am using, and it can be tedious to have to click 3 times on one button to cycle the sensitivity back to my original one.  The mouse wheel is extra wide which is amazing.  The rubber grip on it ensures that you don't slip when using the scroll wheel.Lastly, this mouse's light weight feeling also gives it a feeling of being \"cheap.\"  I do not look at this mouse as being cheap at all, but more like a very good value for what you get.  With that said, maybe it is just me and a heavier weighted mouse would make that feeling go away.  The low weight, however, makes it every easy to move the mouse a tiny distance on screen.  Which leads me to the mouse feet.  My R.A.T. 7 felt like it would jump around a bit when I would try to move my crosshair a tiny distance.  I think this was a combination of the mouse feet and the wide, wide design of the mouse.  This mouse has NO issue with tiny movements and I feel like I can manipulate the mouse very easily and securely.  SCORE: 9/10Value:Cannot beat the value.  I paid 17.00 with overnight Prime shipping for a 6-button, braided cable, laser mouse with adjustable sensitivity and awesome button switches.  I cannot find a good reason to use my other mice over this one.  SCORE: 10/10Overall Score: 9.25/10I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The price is low enough that you have no reason to have it, even as a backup mouse.  Some mice are good for certain things, so if you find that you don't need your ultra-hyped, overrated $75 mouse, give this one a try.  I would buy it again and will now look at Redragon's other products (such as their keyboards)."}

I then downloaded a similar yet different software for the M910KS/M910-WS mouse, (it looked like it could be wired or wireless) and it worked correctly. I'm able to change DPI settings intricately, the color settings, et cetera. This software was also the one that seems to be depicted in the images for this mouse model.

It is now 2020. I am still using it. It still works as well as the day I got it.Left button still clicks. Right button still clicks. Scroll wheel still scrolls. Side buttons still work. Except in some situations, namely certain games that I'm pretty sure don't accept extra mouse button inputs anyway. For example, in Deus Ex Human Revolution, Bioshock, and Starcraft 2 they don't work, but in Fallout: New Vegas, Metro 2033, and Dota 2 they work perfectly. Seems more a problem with the games themselves than with the mouse. Regardless, their primary function, to go forward and backward on most web pages, still works fine. I use it regularly- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, even gaming apps like Steam, Origin, Battlenet, and Gog- it's a great unexpected utility. It's easy not to click them if you don't want to unless you have fat thumbs or a lack of muscle control; luckily I have neither but YMMV. It's a hardy piece of hardware. In the games I mentioned above, you need to do a lot of clicking. A lot. Honestly I've clicked it so many times that sometimes my fingers get tired (especially in RTS/Moba which take a LOT of clicking) but the mouse still clicks. It's been three years, I must have clicked hundreds of thousands of times if not millions, and it Still. Keeps. Clicking. Granted I keep it clean and pristine and don't let it get gummed up with cheeto dust or bbq seasoning but it should go without saying that you take care of your electronics or they don't work as well later.The weight and the DPI adjustments are functional, I just don't use them. I removed the weights because they bothered me bu hey they're removable so no harm no foul. Some certain games with messed up mouse acceleration or weird sensitivity input (looking at you, Dead Space) do require a DPI adjustment. There's only 3 tiers which is meh but it's better than none or having 3 million tiers. The lasers are incredibly functional on a variety of surfaces and the material is smooth enough that many surfaces can be used well. Mattress, mousepad, desk, a pair of jeans, I'm honestly shocked how well it works on different materials. The cord has frayed slightly over the years but that's mostly because in my setup, the cord wraps around my external speakers to plug into my computer, and it seems to have only frayed where it rubs up against the speaker. Even then, only a few strands pop out, and the cord itself is still in great condition. The black and red color palette is inoffensive and helps to see where it is in the dark. And the design overall is pretty sleek and cool. My hand is perfectly sized for the hardware so if your hand is the size of my hand (I have hands of fairly average size) you won't have an issue. I can't speak on battery life because it has a cable.Essentially this is baby's first gaming mouse. It's pretty much right in the middle between a practical one typically used for web browsing etc, and a pure gaming one which, well, is used primarily for playing video games. It's enough that I can use it for both activities without encountering any problems. I have to use it in the correct USB slot or I'll encounter problems, but that shouldn't come as a shock to anybody who knows basic electronics. I trust Redragon brand enough that when I buy a keyboard and replacement mouse (if this one ever breaks) it'll be them. Thanks for three years of a good mouse Redragon; here's to three more."}
{"asin": "B0B96PKNVL", "username": "Tyler Quiring", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nGood mouse; instructions for fixing squeaky LMB.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2015", "purchased": "Color: Black Wired MouseStyle: Wired Mouse", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "This is a great mouse for cheap and has some nice features. I would give 5 stars if not for two things: It feels too light and the left mouse button often squeaks when clicked. I was able to fix the latter issue myself and I have directions below on how to do so.The mouse seem fairly well built and has been quite responsive on my computer. Personally, I think the appearance could be less garish (no need for an LED backlit logo or red plastic accents). However this is subjective so it doesn't factor into my review. The DPI button is the black chevron just behind the scroll wheel. When clicked, it switches between the various DPI settings which noticeably changes the tracking feel of the mouse on the screen. The scroll wheel has nice bumps between each notch. I feel like these could be a bit more snappy, but it's a very nice-feeling wheel nonetheless. The mouse buttons are responsive but quite audible, so don't buy it if you want a quiet mouse. The forward and back buttons on the left side are placed well for easy access by the right thumb, and the forward button is covered in raised bumps for texture and grip. The mouse feels good in the hand (my hands are medium-sized) and is comfortable for a palm grip. The USB cable seems like it will last a long time. When connected to Windows (7, 64-bit) for the first time, the drivers are found quickly without issue.My two issues with the mouse are rather minor. The first is that it is surprisingly light, and I would like a slightly more weighty feel to provide more resistance across the mousepad. The mouse does come with a set of weights inside, but these should have been made much heavier (or the materials of the mouse itself made heavier) because weights can always be removed but more cannot be added. Redragon should have erred on the side of a heavier mouse that users could make lighter if they wanted instead of a light mouse that can only be made lighter. At any rate, I haven't found the weight to measurably impact my experience with the mouse, it's relatively minor preference.However, the left mouse button began to squeak fairly regularly almost as soon as I started to use the mouse. This should not be the case and should have been caught in quality control before the mouse went to marked. The squeak is rather subtle but just noticeable enough to be aggravating. While the squeak doesn't always occur (and seems to be based on where your finger is on the button when you click) under my normal use I found that it squeaked the majority of the time when I had my finger placed where it was most comfortable for me. However, I was able to fix the click and now I have no remaining significant issues with the mouse, but I took a star off the review because this issue should not need to be fixed by the user.-------INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING THE SQUEAK [Materials needed: Small phillips screwdriver, exacto knife]1. Unplug the mouse and remove the two teflon pads near the rear of the mouse. I used the exacto knife to pry these up and off.2. Remove the 2 screws that hold the top and bottom sections together.3. Pinch the sides of the top section together near the front (but below the buttons). Gently pull the sections apart.4. Turn over the top half and remove the 3 screws holding the circuit board onto the top half. Gently pull the circuit board back and away from the two tabs holding it in place.5. Now with the top half disconnected from the bottom, identify the left mouse button (reversed when upside down). Click the button and notice where the moving plastic part slides past the stationary plastic. Along the inner edge side  of the stationary plastic should be a very slight protrusion that rubs against the moving part. Carefully slice between these two with the exacto knife, putting pressure toward the stationary segment so that you shave away a very slight amount of plastic and the protrusion is removed.6. Test out the button with a number of clicks in different areas to make sure the squeak is gone. If you're certain it is, slide the circuit board back into place, reattach it with the screws, and carefully pinch the sides of the top half together again. Note that there are tabs near the front of the top section that need to slide underneath the matching tabs on the bottom section. This might take a couple of tries, but gently try to match up the tabs and slide the top back into place. Don't use a lot of force! Then replace the bottom screws and the teflon pads and plug the mouse back in.After I reassembled the mouse it still works perfectly fine and the squeak is gone. Hopefully this helps you too."}

I expected a bit more from this mouse, I guess I love buttons, this hasn't been a great choice, it doesn't seem to be awful, either. Somehow I thought I'd be able to use the 6° button for *enter* or something, i once had a fancy trackball with extra buttons/functions.Really, for the regular non-gamer like me, this mouse has the minumum buttons acceptable, l;-click, R-click, forward & back.When one's looking to. buy this, on thee page, further down, you'll see several more mouses Many seem to share the same body shape, and nearly the same lights on the mouse-body. I can't evaluate  those mouses, just mentioning the similarity in appearance.So far, this mouse hasn't been too bad, the frustration of driver-software is something that angered me, So far, this mouse hasn't been too bad, question is---will it at least hold up for a year or more? I'll update if/when  it fails.I guess for a non-gamer, this isn't anything special, but doesn't seem to be the worst possible choice, either. The mouse is always lit, kind of serving as a nightlight. You should probably cover it, as they say even a little light can hurt your sleep, I don't cover it, tho.ORIGINAL REVIEW  18OCT2015:Went to register product--site given on box was wrong. I went to their home page, found I could register from there. Strike one.No software provided w/mouse. Not good. Went to website, clicked to download for * Centrophorus *  mouse. Box says this is a 6 button mouse, yet the box has the strange name I just gave. But on their website, the download is listed as for Centrophorus, a 5-button mouse.--------------------------------I downloaded that, what else could I do? Must restart PC, OK. PC locked up on restart, had to go for a 2nd restart. Finally, I find 5-button software in the start menu. The picture on the set-up software is clearly not a picture of this mouse. On the set-up software, click on *hardware*, of all things, it says the manufacturer is Microsoft!  Since this software is the new stuff on my PC, it must be the driver for this mouse.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just behind the scrollwheel is a chevron, or arrow shaped key. I can depress it, nothing happens. The set-up software that I installed from the Challenger site show no such arrow.--------------------------------------------------------------------I am not a gamer, I bought this based on the good reviews, & supposedly fair price. The  aggravation I encountered in the first hour  of ownership makes me sorry I bought this. I don't care how well it works from here on out--it deserves no more than 2 stars. I doubt that it is a good long-term mouse, & it provides nothing more than a fairly simple mouse. You might want to look elsewhere. Even if I've made a mistake on one of these issues, which I doubt, this was just unpleasant. Its nothing special, & the stupid lights & cute dragon picture should be annoying in short order.--------------------------------------------------------------As a final insult, I went back to the Challenger website. I downloaded the *manual*  for the M601, which is this mouse. The *manual* is the same thing as the useless paper they give you with this mouse. On one side of this paper(long, when unfolded) is Chinese & English writing, telling you nothing of value. The other side of this large sheet is in several European languages. I don't think that side explains anything, either.--------------------------------------So, I've bought myself trouble, at best a near minimal mouse. Bet you could find a much cheaper mouse than this with the same features. And joy of joys, if you keep your PC in your bedroom, maybe you'll need to cover it so as to not mess up your sleep, with the light & all.This thing is pretty, but its really kinda crummy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Notice that under every bad review is a comment by the company to fix things. Do you really think they care? I Don't!!"}

Now that I have gotten used to this mouse, the weight is perfect.  Remember, I was coming from a very heavy R.A.T. 7 mouse that made me feel a bit shocked by how light this one is.  This mouse feels great and, not that the mouse is the ONLY reason, but I did manage to get from Silver Elite Master to DMG on CS:GO playing with this mouse and will not doubt hit The Global Elite down the road a bit.  The mouse is very \"grippy\" in my hands and this is very important, for instance, when you are zoomed in with a sniper rifle awaiting an enemy coming into your view from around a door or corner.  Using more of a claw grip in these instances allows me a ridiculous amount of control over my crosshair movement (in other words, I can accurately move the mouse just a sliver in any given direction).  A big part of this is probably due to the quality of the laser mouse in combination with my sensitivity settings (which for CS:GO are: 1.5 sensitivity, 0.80 scoped in sensitivity, Raw Input = on, and my Windows sensitivity is on the middle tick mark with acceleration off).The buttons have held up superbly.  They are still very responsive, especially with their \"clicky\" feedback.  Of special note is the mouse wheel.  The rubber \"tire\" like covering on it works great and the down-click motion is direct and not sloppy.  You know how some mouses, when you try to click the middle-mouse button, cause you to slip off the wheel or not be able to click it effortlessly?  I haven't ran into that issue yet with this mouse.Still happy with this purchase and I really cannot find a reason NOT to give it 5 stars.  It looks cool, functions great, and has had very little issues.With that said, I am giving it 4 stars due to a driver issue and computer sleep mode issue.  Whenever I put my computer to sleep and then wake it back up, I have to unplug and then re-plug the mouse to get Windows to recognize it.  I Googled this issue and nothing that would indicate it being anything else but this mouse.  My other mice don't have that issue and neither do my other USB devices.Also, I downloaded a driver/software for this mouse from the manufacturer's web site (if I recall correctly) and this caused my mouse to randomly click every few minutes.  During a match in CS:GO, you could imagine how this could really mess things up (sniping, defusing a bomb, maintaining stealth, having a grenade out).  After uninstalling the software, the mouse went back to normal.GET THIS MOUSE!  It really is an amazing value and I'd pay more than I did for it.  I got this for about $17 with Prime shipping.  I would easily have paid $25-30 knowing what I do now.***END UPDATE***Appearance:This mouse looks great, in my opinion.  It has a very aggressive look, and the pairing of a red and black color scheme is a nice touch.  The color LEDs appear on the back of the mouse and both sides which add a very coll effect.  Additionally, the side thumb buttons and the thumb rest are textured and/or slotted for design and grip.  SCORE: 9/10 for appearance.Build quality:So far, the mouse is holding up well.  There is a non-rubberized coating that is more like a matte finish on the main body of the mouse.  This seems to be slip resistant and helps with grip.  The buttons are very \"clicky\" which is great.  I play CS:GO a lot, and I had an issue with my R.A.T. 7 where it felt as if some of the buttons were a bit mushy.  I immediately noticed the difference with the buttons of this mouse and love the switches that the buttons use.  The mouse, overall, feels like it will hold up structurally for some time, and all of the pieces look well-finished and put together.  The braided cable tells me they went the extra mile to make sure this mouse delivers.  SCORE: 9/10Feel:This is the big category for me.  The mouse feels very light, even with the weights inserted into the chassis.  It feels light enough that I almost wish it were just a tad bit heavier, but this could merely be just personal preference.  One other complain I have is the feel of the thumb rest.  It is a piece of textured plastic (which seems like good quality nonetheless).  My gripe is that it would be nice to have something a little \"grippier\" or \"rubbery\" there to make my thumb feel a little more like part of the mouse.  Although, I must say that I enjoy the slotted thumb rest and it seems to help with keeping my hand/thumb cooler.The buttons feel great and responsive.  Not spongy at all.  I love the crisp \"click\" that this mouse has on all of the buttons.  There is only one button to change the sensitivity, so it would have been nice to have another one to change it the opposite way.  In CS:GO, I like to down my sensitivity depending on what weapon I am using, and it can be tedious to have to click 3 times on one button to cycle the sensitivity back to my original one.  The mouse wheel is extra wide which is amazing.  The rubber grip on it ensures that you don't slip when using the scroll wheel.Lastly, this mouse's light weight feeling also gives it a feeling of being \"cheap.\"  I do not look at this mouse as being cheap at all, but more like a very good value for what you get.  With that said, maybe it is just me and a heavier weighted mouse would make that feeling go away.  The low weight, however, makes it every easy to move the mouse a tiny distance on screen.  Which leads me to the mouse feet.  My R.A.T. 7 felt like it would jump around a bit when I would try to move my crosshair a tiny distance.  I think this was a combination of the mouse feet and the wide, wide design of the mouse.  This mouse has NO issue with tiny movements and I feel like I can manipulate the mouse very easily and securely.  SCORE: 9/10Value:Cannot beat the value.  I paid 17.00 with overnight Prime shipping for a 6-button, braided cable, laser mouse with adjustable sensitivity and awesome button switches.  I cannot find a good reason to use my other mice over this one.  SCORE: 10/10Overall Score: 9.25/10I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The price is low enough that you have no reason to have it, even as a backup mouse.  Some mice are good for certain things, so if you find that you don't need your ultra-hyped, overrated $75 mouse, give this one a try.  I would buy it again and will now look at Redragon's other products (such as their keyboards)."}

On the manufacturer's download page, I downloaded the software for the M910RGB (which I assume is the black counterpart to the white version I chose, which has the model number M910-W). It wasn't able to find the mouse as a device, and it looked like it was made in the early 2000's. Notably, this software was not the one advertised in the images provided for the mouse. I then downloaded a similar yet different software for the M910KS/M910-WS mouse, (it looked like it could be wired or wireless) and it worked correctly. I'm able to change DPI settings intricately, the color settings, et cetera. This software was also the one that seems to be depicted in the images for this mouse model.

It is now 2020. I am still using it. It still works as well as the day I got it.Left button still clicks. Right button still clicks. Scroll wheel still scrolls. Side buttons still work. Except in some situations, namely certain games that I'm pretty sure don't accept extra mouse button inputs anyway. For example, in Deus Ex Human Revolution, Bioshock, and Starcraft 2 they don't work, but in Fallout: New Vegas, Metro 2033, and Dota 2 they work perfectly. Seems more a problem with the games themselves than with the mouse. Regardless, their primary function, to go forward and backward on most web pages, still works fine. I use it regularly- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, even gaming apps like Steam, Origin, Battlenet, and Gog- it's a great unexpected utility. It's easy not to click them if you don't want to unless you have fat thumbs or a lack of muscle control; luckily I have neither but YMMV. It's a hardy piece of hardware. In the games I mentioned above, you need to do a lot of clicking. A lot. Honestly I've clicked it so many times that sometimes my fingers get tired (especially in RTS/Moba which take a LOT of clicking) but the mouse still clicks. It's been three years, I must have clicked hundreds of thousands of times if not millions, and it Still. Keeps. Clicking. Granted I keep it clean and pristine and don't let it get gummed up with cheeto dust or bbq seasoning but it should go without saying that you take care of your electronics or they don't work as well later.The weight and the DPI adjustments are functional, I just don't use them. I removed the weights because they bothered me bu hey they're removable so no harm no foul. Some certain games with messed up mouse acceleration or weird sensitivity input (looking at you, Dead Space) do require a DPI adjustment. There's only 3 tiers which is meh but it's better than none or having 3 million tiers. The lasers are incredibly functional on a variety of surfaces and the material is smooth enough that many surfaces can be used well. Mattress, mousepad, desk, a pair of jeans, I'm honestly shocked how well it works on different materials. The cord has frayed slightly over the years but that's mostly because in my setup, the cord wraps around my external speakers to plug into my computer, and it seems to have only frayed where it rubs up against the speaker. Even then, only a few strands pop out, and the cord itself is still in great condition. The black and red color palette is inoffensive and helps to see where it is in the dark. And the design overall is pretty sleek and cool. My hand is perfectly sized for the hardware so if your hand is the size of my hand (I have hands of fairly average size) you won't have an issue. I can't speak on battery life because it has a cable.Essentially this is baby's first gaming mouse. It's pretty much right in the middle between a practical one typically used for web browsing etc, and a pure gaming one which, well, is used primarily for playing video games. It's enough that I can use it for both activities without encountering any problems. I have to use it in the correct USB slot or I'll encounter problems, but that shouldn't come as a shock to anybody who knows basic electronics. I trust Redragon brand enough that when I buy a keyboard and replacement mouse (if this one ever breaks) it'll be them. Thanks for three years of a good mouse Redragon; here's to three more."}
{"asin": "B0B96PKNVL", "username": "Tyler Quiring", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nGood mouse; instructions for fixing squeaky LMB.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2015", "purchased": "Color: Black Wired MouseStyle: Wired Mouse", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "This is a great mouse for cheap and has some nice features. I would give 5 stars if not for two things: It feels too light and the left mouse button often squeaks when clicked. I was able to fix the latter issue myself and I have directions below on how to do so.The mouse seem fairly well built and has been quite responsive on my computer. Personally, I think the appearance could be less garish (no need for an LED backlit logo or red plastic accents). However this is subjective so it doesn't factor into my review. The DPI button is the black chevron just behind the scroll wheel. When clicked, it switches between the various DPI settings which noticeably changes the tracking feel of the mouse on the screen. The scroll wheel has nice bumps between each notch. I feel like these could be a bit more snappy, but it's a very nice-feeling wheel nonetheless. The mouse buttons are responsive but quite audible, so don't buy it if you want a quiet mouse. The forward and back buttons on the left side are placed well for easy access by the right thumb, and the forward button is covered in raised bumps for texture and grip. The mouse feels good in the hand (my hands are medium-sized) and is comfortable for a palm grip. The USB cable seems like it will last a long time. When connected to Windows (7, 64-bit) for the first time, the drivers are found quickly without issue.My two issues with the mouse are rather minor. The first is that it is surprisingly light, and I would like a slightly more weighty feel to provide more resistance across the mousepad. The mouse does come with a set of weights inside, but these should have been made much heavier (or the materials of the mouse itself made heavier) because weights can always be removed but more cannot be added. Redragon should have erred on the side of a heavier mouse that users could make lighter if they wanted instead of a light mouse that can only be made lighter. At any rate, I haven't found the weight to measurably impact my experience with the mouse, it's relatively minor preference.However, the left mouse button began to squeak fairly regularly almost as soon as I started to use the mouse. This should not be the case and should have been caught in quality control before the mouse went to marked. The squeak is rather subtle but just noticeable enough to be aggravating. While the squeak doesn't always occur (and seems to be based on where your finger is on the button when you click) under my normal use I found that it squeaked the majority of the time when I had my finger placed where it was most comfortable for me. However, I was able to fix the click and now I have no remaining significant issues with the mouse, but I took a star off the review because this issue should not need to be fixed by the user.-------INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING THE SQUEAK [Materials needed: Small phillips screwdriver, exacto knife]1. Unplug the mouse and remove the two teflon pads near the rear of the mouse. I used the exacto knife to pry these up and off.2. Remove the 2 screws that hold the top and bottom sections together.3. Pinch the sides of the top section together near the front (but below the buttons). Gently pull the sections apart.4. Turn over the top half and remove the 3 screws holding the circuit board onto the top half. Gently pull the circuit board back and away from the two tabs holding it in place.5. Now with the top half disconnected from the bottom, identify the left mouse button (reversed when upside down). Click the button and notice where the moving plastic part slides past the stationary plastic. Along the inner edge side  of the stationary plastic should be a very slight protrusion that rubs against the moving part. Carefully slice between these two with the exacto knife, putting pressure toward the stationary segment so that you shave away a very slight amount of plastic and the protrusion is removed.6. Test out the button with a number of clicks in different areas to make sure the squeak is gone. If you're certain it is, slide the circuit board back into place, reattach it with the screws, and carefully pinch the sides of the top half together again. Note that there are tabs near the front of the top section that need to slide underneath the matching tabs on the bottom section. This might take a couple of tries, but gently try to match up the tabs and slide the top back into place. Don't use a lot of force! Then replace the bottom screws and the teflon pads and plug the mouse back in.After I reassembled the mouse it still works perfectly fine and the squeak is gone. Hopefully this helps you too."}

But on their website, the download is listed as for Centrophorus, a 5-button mouse.--------------------------------I downloaded that, what else could I do? Must restart PC, OK. PC locked up on restart, had to go for a 2nd restart. Finally, I find 5-button software in the start menu. The picture on the set-up software is clearly not a picture of this mouse. On the set-up software, click on *hardware*, of all things, it says the manufacturer is Microsoft!  Since this software is the new stuff on my PC, it must be the driver for this mouse.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just behind the scrollwheel is a chevron, or arrow shaped key. I can depress it, nothing happens. The set-up software that I installed from the Challenger site show no such arrow.--------------------------------------------------------------------I am not a gamer, I bought this based on the good reviews, & supposedly fair price. The  aggravation I encountered in the first hour  of ownership makes me sorry I bought this. I don't care how well it works from here on out--it deserves no more than 2 stars. I doubt that it is a good long-term mouse, & it provides nothing more than a fairly simple mouse. You might want to look elsewhere. Even if I've made a mistake on one of these issues, which I doubt, this was just unpleasant. Its nothing special, & the stupid lights & cute dragon picture should be annoying in short order.--------------------------------------------------------------As a final insult, I went back to the Challenger website. I downloaded the *manual*  for the M601, which is this mouse. The *manual* is the same thing as the useless paper they give you with this mouse. On one side of this paper(long, when unfolded) is Chinese & English writing, telling you nothing of value. The other side of this large sheet is in several European languages. I don't think that side explains anything, either.--------------------------------------So, I've bought myself trouble, at best a near minimal mouse. Bet you could find a much cheaper mouse than this with the same features. And joy of joys, if you keep your PC in your bedroom, maybe you'll need to cover it so as to not mess up your sleep, with the light & all.This thing is pretty, but its really kinda crummy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Notice that under every bad review is a comment by the company to fix things. Do you really think they care? I Don't!!"}

{"asin": "B0B96PKNVL", "username": "HanR", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nShocked, low cost but quality product, exceeded my expectations in terms of value", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2017", "purchased": "Color: Black Wired MouseStyle: Wired Mouse", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Alright, so to be clear - this mouse has a sensor that will not compete with a name brand companies optical gaming grade sensor in terms of tracking and consistency (ie. Logitech, SteelSeries, Zowie, etc.). Now let's continue to the review.At the price point of $12.99 this mouse definitely exceeded my expectations. Seriously for the price I was not expecting much, mainly the reviews and non-outrageous looking pictures of the product drew me in. I work from home time to time along with playing games quite a bit, I love FPS games particularly. I got this as a \"back-up\" mouse as i'm used to using a rival 300 (and like quality mice) for FPS games and such (competitive). My requirements for a back-up mouse were simple - needs forward and back buttons, doesn't look to crazy, does what it's supposed to do. My rival had recently broke after several years of reliable performance. The build quality on this mouse appears to be on-point. Nothing felt loose or cheap about the process while inspecting it/holding it in my hand right from the unbox. The mouse clicks were firm and comparable to most gaming mice i've used in the past, they have an omron click feel (to me).Now for my take aways:The sensor seems to be a little sluggish at times, nothing super critical but coming from a high quality sensor it was definitely something noticeable, but at $12.99 it was something to be expected. Their is a reason most newer/more known gaming mice go for more of a premium price, being around $60-80. I will note that most premium gaming mice do include custom UI software that allow for more in-depth custom tuning. If you're looking for that you will not find it here but come on.... $12.99...Definitely made for a crowd with smaller hands. The rival 300 was a little bit big for me but still comfortable, this mouse definitely is a lot smaller but still fits alright for me. An extended gaming session could yield some discomfort, but again depends on your grip style and size of your hand.The side grips on this mouse are plastic, probably helps with durability/life of the mouse shell and cosmetic appearance but doesn't sit well with me in lines of comfort. Not a huge deal for the purpose that I bought it for but something definitely worth noting.The red led light is constantly in a \"breathing\" mode but it doesn't really bother me as i'm used to rgb lighting.Most places i've seen this mouse advertised promote custom UI software but this (currently) does not appear to be the case. Mouse settings in windows control panel seems to be your options for remapping which for me is not a big deal but was definitely a misleading thing. If you're trying to bind custom loops then you might be disappointed.The shape of the mouse takes some getting used to, a combination of the smaller size and plastic wrapped completely around (rigidness). I'm used to mice shaped more towards ambi with a slight right-handed dominant contour.Overall, even with my takeaways they were not critical enough of issues to really bring the rating of this product down for me. The build quality is nice. Braided cable. Lengthy cable. Crisp lighting (for those who are into that sort of thing). On the fly dpi switching.If you're considering this product I would recommend it. Good for any one on a budget, looking for a decent back-up until a major name replacement, or someone who just doesn't care about brand names. I've read reviews of others who had faulty mice, no issues on my end so far. If I run into anything I will update this review but i'm currently awaiting my main replacement which is going to be a zowie fk2. As I said from the start I will leave you with, if you're coming from a major name gaming mouse this will not be 100% comparable in terms of accuracy of the sensor. Don't expect a Zowie, Logitech, SteelSeries, etc. comparable sensor. I would recommend this product. Great back-up, or entry level gaming mouse."}

I originally bought a black with blue lights gaming mouse from another maker that had over 1500 reviews with a 4-star rating for a few dollars cheaper and I absolutely regretted it. That other brand was the Tecknet M268 black mouse with blue lighting didn't feel at all right in my hand. The plastic had no real texture to it and actually felt cheap and somewhat thin and brittle. Worst part was the cursor tracking. Trying to click on the X of a web page or a window was a nightmare. The cursor was jumpy and unstable and playing games on a 2560x1440 resolution screen where everything you needed to click on was tiny was impossible. I tried using different mouse pads and surfaces and nothing made it better. I had to return that and I'm glad I did.My new Redragon Centrophorus is the complete opposite of the other brand's. Here are the points of the Redragon I find superior to the other mouse:- The feel is just right. The weights inside this mouse gave it a nice heavier quality feel and movement of more expensive mice I own.- All the buttons have a nice if not perfectly satisfying resistance and \"click.\" Even the wheel button feels good and solid when I press on it. The other mouse's buttons actually felt clunky and somewhat hollow sounding.- The cord wrapped in red and black braided fiber adds a nice touch which also looks and feels great compared to the other one. I didn't realize there was a difference between braided cords until I felt the 2 side-by-side.- The red light inside slowly pulses illuminating the all the crevises, windows, and logo is just beautiful. The other one was just a dim blue light that was always on.- The center button to change the DPI actually makes a difference when I press it. The first level makes the cursor move slow and the 4th level makes it zip across the screen with barely a flick of the wrist. My favorite and most used it the second level.- It comes in a reusable plastic storage box with a form fitted clear plastic inner packaging shell and a locking lid that snaps closed on all four sides. The box even has the logo imprinted onto the lid. The other one came in a small thin brown cardboard box I've already tossed in the recycle bin (I hope it's recyclable!)- Best of all and most important in my opinion is the incredibly smooth, accurate, and precise tracking ability of the mouse cursor. It seems to just glide across the screen and gives me absolute control of where I want it to go and lands dead-on to what I need to click. It actually has more control than all of my 50 dollar plus Logitech mice. No exaggerating! I think it might be due to the driver and software I downloaded for the Redragon, but it was worth it. This is one point that I'm sure anyone will agree on. If a mouse can't give you precise control and do what it's supposed to besides looking good then it's a waste of money no matter how little you spend on it.Overall, for only literally a few dollars more, this mouse has surprisingly exceeded all of my expectations and is an absolute pleasure to use. I noticed my PC gaming had improved due to not missing any of the buttons anymore or taking extra time and effort to correctly position the cursor where I need it to be. I always thought great gaming mice had to be expensive, but Redragon really changed my views about that. You won't be disappointed with this one."}

My old mouse didn't have any issues but this one doesn't register movement sometimes which is annoying. There's a button on the side for rapid fire action where it'll shoot 3 rapid shots, like an autoclicker, which is cool or would've been. But the buttons so far away from where you can comfortably reach it with your thumb that I don't usually want to bother with it since it'll mess up your aim trying. in conclusion...it's alright. I mean it's a mouse. It'll work like a mouse but don't expect better performance or anything special, it's pretty ordinary and like I said, I did better with my $4 walmart onn brand mouse so I might even switch back.  you'll likely have issues with the software too.

I used it to accompany a really low-grade laptop that I used for just about everything that required internet access when I wasn't in high school. I had used it all throughout high school and am using it through college and for casual gaming on the side as well.Now the durability of this thing is impressive in my case compared to many other reviews I see here. It has fallen off tables onto solid stone floors and average school floors (hard tiles and such) multiple times without so much as a slight dent to the outer shell part. The only parts to sustain long-term damage have been the USB portion of the cable where it has slightly warped over the years due to how I would wrap it, and the connecting portion of the cable to the mouse body which has started to show bare wires with their internal coverings intact.As for the consistency in the useability of the mouse.The multiple sensitivity settings have been of great use in day-to-day life with a very easy switch at any time. The mouse wheel has not degraded or slipped in any way for me. The movement is only VERY SLIGHTLY jittery when trying to do precise movements. The buttons on the side I have yet to actually do much of anything with, leaving them as quick access back and forth buttons for browsing has actually been my preferred setting with them.Even now after I've upgraded my set up to a full-blown tower with a new keyboard, headset, and monitor this mouse still holds up to everything I require from it.The only real downside I can point out is maybe how easily it gets dirty over time with the design of it including so many open holes near where my thumb rests, allowing for nasty dirt and sweat build-up over time. Also, the mouse is slightly too small to fit the right side of my hand. My hands are just about average size and my ring finger and pinky have to hang off awkwardly to the side most of the time which can cause them to cramp up if I'm not careful and make sure to move them once in a while.Other than that I definitely recommend buying this mouse for the sheer durability offered by it at such a price range. 3.5/5"}

So instead of clicking on the internet back or forward button on the webpage you can do it on your mouse.In front of the mouse it showcases the RGB looks truly amazing definitely helps at night on my mousepad to see in front of me lol.

Oh my gosh where to start. The mouse I used previous to this Redragon was a Microsoft Mobile 3500 model, which is a small wireless mouse that I used for the past year. The 3500 mobil model is great for travel and bringing to class when I am on my college campus, but not great for everything. So I decided to get another mouse that might be better for my gaming and more at home use. I saw this mouse and thought that for 14 dollars I can try out this highly rated game mouse and loved it. I play games often so this mouse has started improving everything I do in that sense. It has great response time and I love that is has customizable side buttons that I can bind in game. Its also nice to have a button that changes the mouse dpi setting with just one click. Its nice if you prefer your mouse more sensitive in game and less sensitive out of it (like I do. I like having it at 2000 dpi in game and 1600 outside). On top of that I think it looks really cool. Overall I love almost everything about it.Almost everything. There is one issue I run into and I know I am not alone. It has to do with the driver/mouse. When I first was trying this mouse out I was excited to bind the buttons on the side to commands for the game I play most (tf2). When I got in the game and tried to bind the buttons they did not respond and instead they both registered as m3 instead of m4 or m5. I was very confused and so I did some looking around online on how to fix that, because I thought that the software that I got from the official website (www.redragonzone.com) would take care of that. Turns out that every time you restart the computer you need to open the set-up and repair the driver. It doesn't take long (less time than checking my e-mail everyday) and you only have to do that repair after your comp shut's down and starts back up again. To me its not a big issue and I am just fine with it, but if that would bug you than this is not the mouse for you.Overall this mouse is fantastic, and for 14 dollars I don't know if you can get a better deal. I definitely recommend this anyone looking for a game mouse but cannot spend a lot of money on it.As a side note, here are some other specs that are on the box that are not listed in the Amazon page (I want to include this so you can get and even better Idea about the mouse):- Gold Plated USB plug- 10 million click life- 8 mm width scroller- 5 Programmable buttons (as the 6th is the one that changes the dpi and the program has no way to change that.)"}

All buttons even the DPI setting button on top.  It seems the only reason for software is to control light and a GUI for the settings.  Personally, I'm not going to install the software as I don't know this company and frankly, don't trust software out of China.This is a Made in China mouse - I wanted something corded and inexpensive and this fit that bill.  Plus, the pulsing glow is satisfyingly cool.  It rotates all colors all on it's own.The DPI setting works as expected - I had to change the default promptly but the mouse does remember its setting so you should be able to set it and forget it.-Feel-This mouse stuck out because of the weights included, however I find it is hardly noticeable with the weights in or out.  I like a heaver mouse, which I thought this was, but it feels lighter.  Just my opinion.Last, the mouse is rather flat and not very curved on top.  Again, I like more curve and this falls short of my desires.There is nothing wrong with the mouse.  If I shopped this in the store, I might not have bought it though.- Impression -I was very impressed with packaging.  It comes in a translucent plastic box with locks on 4 sides.  Inside, the mouse is snug in a plastic tray along with a brand logo (who doesn't love stickers!) and instructions.  The instruction manual has about 6 pages dedicated to each language known to man - it's a book!- Recommendation -I would recommend this mouse to someone who isn't like me.  I like a heavier mouse and one with more curve on the top.  I'm probably a little picky, but I use my computer for work and play so I want comfortable-to-me tools.  There isn't anything I can say negative objectively about the mouse.I believe it is worth the price and would satisfy most people's needs."}
{"asin": "B0B96PKNVL", "username": "Chris J", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nQuality and durable mouse for the cost", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2016", "purchased": "Color: Black Wired MouseStyle: Wired Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The Redragon M601 is a mouse for the casual, penny-saving gamer. It has a unique design, is made of sturdy material, and has a decent amount of adjustability, all the while brandishing a price of lower than $15. There are very few alternatives out there that you could find that include all of the features of the M601 at such a low cost.Design and ComfortAside from the cost, the design and comfort of the M601 was the main selling point of the product. The design of the M601 is rather unique in that, instead of having rounded edges all around the mouse, it has pointed edges at the front which gives it the look of a dragon's claw. This coupled with the glowing Redragon icon at the base of the mouse gives the whole thing a sense of fantasy created around the Redragon name. But the design is used for more than just creating a fantasy around the product. The pointed edges towards the front of the mouse are slightly raised up on the sides which creates an indent in the middle of the mouse buttons where your fingers can rest comfortably. The edges are used as a way to guide your fingers into the middle of the left and right mouse buttons which makes it easy and comfortable for your fingers to rest and click on the middle of the buttons where it is easiest to get a response. Overall, the design of the mouse creates the experience of guiding a dragon's claw while simultaneously creating a comfortable mouse to rest your hands on.DurabilityAfter just over six months of continual use, there has been no noticeable degradation in my M601. The M601 is made of very sturdy materials and has a tight constitution meaning that there are no loose parts or buttons flopping around when the mouse gets moved from one place to another. Each click of the mouse is distinct and responsive. The cord is about 6 feet long and braided the whole way.PerformanceThe actual performance of the mouse is solid. The changeable DPI button works perfectly with its three adjustable setting. The two side buttons work as intended and the mouse's optical sensor is very responsive. The only stumble in performance that has been shown is this weird bug where if the computer is ever put to sleep then started back up again, the mouse will not work. The simple solution to this problem is just simply to unplug and plug back in mouse. This bug does not happen if you shut down or restart the computer, it only ever happens when the computer is put to sleep. It is a simple problem with an easy solution.Overall, this mouse is great for a casual gamer. It gives the perks of high end costing mice, like the adjustable DPI and durable construction, while also holding the cost of a low end mouse. If you are a casual gamer looking for a new, adjustable mouse while also looking to keep your wallet intact, this is the mouse you are looking for."}

I've had two within the past year, but I honestly can't blame the manufacturers. This mouse can take some ABUSE! My cats push it off the table onto the wood floor every day, multiple times a day. They've chewed on the cord, they've ripped it out of the USB port... anything you can think of. I eventually ran into disconnecting issues with the first mouse, but like I said it took abuse. My \"new\" 6 month old mouse is still going strong. My boyfriend coincidentally has the same mouse, and he's had it for about a year and a half with no issues.For the price, I really can't complain about this mouse. It has a nice textured feel to it, the USB connector fits well in my USB port, the cord is high quality braided nylon. The color scheme is good, gamers love our edgy red LED lights. It's bright, so you might need to unplug it at night.KEEP IN MIND, for those of you buying your first gaming mouse or looking for a present: 6 buttons means the left click, the right click, the center scroll wheel, 2 side buttons, and the DPI button. Mouses advertised as 6 buttons only have 4 that you can use (5 if you count the scroll wheel).PROS:-Good price-Textured grip, so even sweaty hands won't drop it-High quality braided nylon cord, colored black and red to match the mouse-Edgy color scheme (the red LEDs are nice and bright, you might need to unplug it at night)-Plug and play-no customization of the software required-Customizable weights, which I was unable to try on this mouse but is a good feature nonetheless (more on this in the cons section)-Good size- bigger than a \"regular\" mouse but not too big for my hands, which I have run into before.-Works perfectly on random surfaces-I usually play on my bed or on the couch and I have yet to need a mousepad.CONS:-Long cord- like, way too long. I could sit 6 feet away from my computer and still use this mouse. It's annoying and it gets in the way. Plus I'm sure over time it will start to kink and cause issues.-The cover that holds in the weights just fell off after a day of use before I was able to mess with them, and now I can't find it or the weights. The mouse works well without them though, although it will feel light if you are used to weights.Overall, this seems like a good mouse for the casual gamer.

I use my mouse via Bluetooth connection, and have found that it seems pretty reliable.  No issues I've noticed there, yet.In my hand, it feels pretty good.  I had the corded Deathadder for quite some time, and it feels nearly identical.  Razer did add some better grippy pads around the sides at some point, and I get a much better grip on the mouse when gaming now.  It looks well-made with nice aesthetics and a color-changing LED for folks into all the custom lighting for their computers.The buttons on the side are great.  Good feel and a light clickiness to them.  The main left and right buttons feel a bit heavy for my preference, especially compared to the wired Deathadder I've had for a while.  I think the optical switch change made since my older version was made means heavier clicking mechanism to simulate a mechanical switch.Charging port is fine.  I appreciate that Razer recessed it a bit as a way to support the micro USB connector when plugged in for charging.  And speaking of charging, I would love to use the Razer charging dock, since this mouse supports that accessory.  I just can't justify $50 for a charger, though.Battery life is pretty good.  I think I charge about once per week with moderate gaming and web surfing.  The battery is sealed inside the mouse, so it is not considered replaceable.  I have not looked into DIY replacement, but I'm sure I won't need to worry about that for quite some time.I don't really use, but still appreciate, the DPI adjustment buttons.  They let me dial things in upon first setup, but I don't generally change the DPI on my mouse once I get used to it.The slick pads on the bottom have good surface area to let the mouse really glide with support.  No super-tiny pads here, and I suspect the extra contact area will help them last a little longer.  The bottom also has a small cover over the spot for housing the 2.4GHz wireless dongle.  Since I'm running with Bluetooth, I just left the dongle in there and have not tested it for range or reliability.Overall, I like this mouse.  It has the same feel as the original Deathadder without the restriction of a cord.  My only gripe is the heavier clicking on the left/right buttons, and I hope they lighten up a bit over time with some more use."}

With others there is a tendency for the pointer to move away from the target when using the middle button to open a link in a new tab. Also, NO BATTERIES. This mouse is rechargeable via a USB connection. It can be used while it is charging.There is a profile button on the underside. I have no clue what that does. Presumably it requires establishing profiles with the Razer software; synapse which requires Windows or MAC.With Linux the buttons work as expected with the exception of the two buttons on the top of the mouse. The bindings cannot be changed because, if you do [#xev -event button | grep button], those two are trapped as button 3 which is the right button.I have tried both the USB dongle and Bluetooth. Both work as expected.This is a high quality mouse that should last a very long time. My only complaint is the micro-print manual to save paper. I found it unreadable without a magnifying glass."}

It takes some time to get used to, but when you do it feels better. It also feels much lighter and moves a lot better thanks to it's mouse feet (or whatever they are called, little rubbers at the bottom), which are better than the ones on G pro. G pro is safe choice if you want mouse with traditional ergonomics, and it's a very good mouse, but razer just feels better. Also I have large hands, but I was able to use both with palm, claw and fingertip grip without any problems. G pro is slightly better for fingertip grip and Deathadder is slightly better for palm grip, but I could use them with both grips without issues.

The synapse app is much less invasive than it used to be. You can turn off all of the advertising notifications and just use it for managing the mouse if you want to.

I use my mouse via Bluetooth connection, and have found that it seems pretty reliable.  No issues I've noticed there, yet.In my hand, it feels pretty good.  I had the corded Deathadder for quite some time, and it feels nearly identical.  Razer did add some better grippy pads around the sides at some point, and I get a much better grip on the mouse when gaming now.  It looks well-made with nice aesthetics and a color-changing LED for folks into all the custom lighting for their computers.The buttons on the side are great.  Good feel and a light clickiness to them.  The main left and right buttons feel a bit heavy for my preference, especially compared to the wired Deathadder I've had for a while.  I think the optical switch change made since my older version was made means heavier clicking mechanism to simulate a mechanical switch.Charging port is fine.  I appreciate that Razer recessed it a bit as a way to support the micro USB connector when plugged in for charging.  And speaking of charging, I would love to use the Razer charging dock, since this mouse supports that accessory.  I just can't justify $50 for a charger, though.Battery life is pretty good.  I think I charge about once per week with moderate gaming and web surfing.  The battery is sealed inside the mouse, so it is not considered replaceable.  I have not looked into DIY replacement, but I'm sure I won't need to worry about that for quite some time.I don't really use, but still appreciate, the DPI adjustment buttons.  They let me dial things in upon first setup, but I don't generally change the DPI on my mouse once I get used to it.The slick pads on the bottom have good surface area to let the mouse really glide with support.  No super-tiny pads here, and I suspect the extra contact area will help them last a little longer.  The bottom also has a small cover over the spot for housing the 2.4GHz wireless dongle.  Since I'm running with Bluetooth, I just left the dongle in there and have not tested it for range or reliability.Overall, I like this mouse.  It has the same feel as the original Deathadder without the restriction of a cord.  My only gripe is the heavier clicking on the left/right buttons, and I hope they lighten up a bit over time with some more use."}

Presumably it requires establishing profiles with the Razer software; synapse which requires Windows or MAC.With Linux the buttons work as expected with the exception of the two buttons on the top of the mouse. The bindings cannot be changed because, if you do [#xev -event button | grep button], those two are trapped as button 3 which is the right button.I have tried both the USB dongle and Bluetooth.

{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Buyer.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nGood Mouse. Worth more.  Bought to replace my Razer Trinitys.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023", "purchased": "Color: Black", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I have several Razer Trinity wired Mice.  They are on all my computers.  I do not play games bit I like to program the buttons to do may of the repetitive clicking like copy, paste, cut and so on.  All of the Razers, the left button/clicking started to bounce and I slowly replaced with cheaper mice from my used drawer.  Razers are not cheap.  When the mouse from my main computer started to bounce, I decided to buy a new programmable mouse.  (I prefer wired although a bit clutter but I loose the dongles all the time and do not want them anymore, be it Logi, Razer, Utech or 3-D connection.  I have so many and all take up a slot.)I read all the reviews that had more than 10 reviews, haha, and found this with 4.5 review with 5% 1 rating.  I bought one to test it out before I buy more for the other computers.I am very happy with my buy.  The shipping from Amz is always been fast but the mouse was works well.  I use the 12X side buttons on Razer (why would you include 3 side to increase the price and they are cluttered in the drawer) so I duplicated the button assignment.  They work well and due to my experience with the other mouse it was easy to reassign all the buttons.  There was a bit of nomenclature difference so just a little stumble but ok.  The mouse worked similar to Razer and will buy more after few more days.With Razer I have to download  a large software to have the mouse working but with Utech (wired) the directory size is 11.6 Mb Vs 948Mb for Razer.  (Geez, Give me a break!)  I was surprised to find that just a driver was able to do this.  I attached the screenshot for FYI.Now I have not used it much, only 1 day, so I will update as time goes.  I did have an event when I clicked one of the buttons, it went to \"Show Desktop\" which is one of the buttons programmed.  This could be that I am not used to the mouse.  I will see if this happens or if other buttons misbehave.  Too early to tell.This is for the Utech people or others on my thoughts:- The USB connector is long compared to Razer so it sticks out.  I think being shorter does not detract from the function so should be shorter.- The cord is much thicker and stiffer so I was a bit disappointed.  This also should be able to be smaller and softer.- The \"Fire\" button next to the left click is nice extra and works as an \"enter / double click\" but for me it would be much better if it was about 1/4 inch or 6 mm closer to my finger so it can be clicked easier.  I honestly do not think it will interfere with left clicking- The clicking pressure is a bit more that Razer but I am sure I will get used to it.- I like the \"Thumb rest\" but would be better if it was raised  about 3 mm the thumb is already closer to the buttons.  The buttons have some pressure resistance so this would not be a issue with accidental clicking.  I put a silicone foam pad to raise it and have more comfort.- The slant on the right side of the mouse can be more vertical so I can pick up the mouse with my thumb and 3rd finger in case you want to.  This would not interfere with molding the case.  I put another foam pad to aid in comfort and friction but due to curvature, pad is lifting off.- There is a \"tactile rise\" on the 5th and the 8th button but I would have preferred it a bit higher.  Although it is there, I could not feel it much.  They did put some thought into it so this is good.  Razer does not have it so even after years of use I sometime look down.So far this is it.  I like to add some follow up after more use."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "IvyX", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nUpdated review for Wireless Version", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2016", "purchased": "Color: Black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Wireless Version Review:After many years, it was finally time to replace my beloved wired Venus gaming mouse. The left click button was consistently double clicking when I only clicked once, but after 7 years everything else was still working great including all the other buttons and profiles in the software. Unfortunately when I bought the same mouse last year, the software and drivers no longer work and made using the profiles and changing settings in the UtechSmart application impossible. I decided to go back to my old (although dysfunctional) one and this year decided to try the wireless version.Set up was surprisingly easy given how much trouble I had last time, I really like how the software and drivers come on a usb flashdrive now instead of on the website or a mini disc. This ensures you have some drivers that should make the mouse work in it's most basic iteration. It worked as soon as I plugged it in, and the flash drive as well. You can only have two profiles with the wireless version (and switch between then using the button on the bottom of the mouse), but all the buttons are still programmable and you can the light settings on the mouse or turn them off entirely if you don't like the feature or want to save battery, and you can do this on both the app or the mouse itself. The light also goes into sleep mode until you move it again if you don't use it for awhile but leave the mouse on. One thing I don't like is that I think it was easier to program the buttons in the old version, now you have to use macros multi-key input if you want to set hotkeys for buttons that aren't already in it's drop down menu.The buttons and scroll wheel feel as nice as I expected. The side buttons are a little less mushy than the wired version, but to be honest that never bothered me much. I don't play competitive games and like having a mouse like this for MMO's and sandbox games like Ark that have a lot of actions that we can hotkey. Overall I think this mouse will still fit my needs and I have always loved the design. The only other mouse I've ever seen that was similar is by Razr but their products have always felt really cheap for how expensive they are. This mouse is half the price and feels a lot nicer. The slightly rubberized texture feels nice in the hand and wears well over time. The curve is very ergonomic for my average to smallish sized hands. I'm really happy to have found a version that still works for me.Below is my original review for the wired version from 2015, not sure it combines them and I'm unable to write a separate/new review.I have been using this mouse for about 10 months. I'm not sure when exactly but at some point it started to turn off and on if I accidentally bumped the USB part of the cable when it was plugged in. For the longest time I thought it was just my computer's USB port (the mouse and cable itself still look physically perfect and I took very good care of it) but over the last few weeks it started to do it quite frequently when even just moving the mouse and eventually it stopped turning on all together when plugged in. At that point I realized it had been the cord all along as it would not turn on no matter what USB port I plugged it into. I had purchased an extended warranty when I bought the mouse but when I called the provider they directed me to contact the manufacturer first as they offer an 18 month warranty. It was a bit difficult to find any contact information on the UtechSmart website (and all I did find was an email address) but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service I received in response. They responded within 24 hours (they were more responsive at night which I thought was a bit weird but this worked well with my schedule) and after a few email questions back and forth over the next business day agreed to send me a replacement. The replacement was sent within one business day and was sent with One Day shipping. Needless to say I was very happy as I had already been without a working mouse for my gaming for a few days.The new mouse seems to be working perfectly but there are a few differences I've noticed from the first one I received 10 months ago that I think are worth noting. The braided cord feels more durable now, the profile color selection now changes the scroll button glow as well, and the texture of the mouse itself has changed. Previously it had a smooth grip texture which I really liked but the new one has a rough/grainy texture which caught me off guard at first. After a few hours I actually came to like it better than the smooth grip the mouse had before.I have read some of the previous views as well and wanted to comment on the mouse and software itself. I have never used a Razer mouse but based on a previous experience with their products and some feedback from my friends I have never been impressed with their quality or durability (a console controller should not break after two months of normal use). I don't really play competitive online games but this mouse has been great for the games I do play (Dragon Age, Rebel Galaxy, Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, etc). I wanted a quality mouse with tons of side buttons to make it easier to get to and use a lot of skills quickly. This mouse has worked out perfectly for that.Yes, the buttons may be considered a bit squishy compared to some of the name brand mice as they are not mechanical but the keys are easy to reach and work well, after a few hours your thumb develops the muscle memory to use the side buttons without issue. Yes, you may not have quite as much control over the settings as you would with one of the name brand mice. However there are still tons of settings you do have control over and I found the software very intuitive and easy to use (especially considering I have not had much experience using these settings in the past). I love the glow feature because it helps me remember to change profiles depending on which game I want to play and it's also just aesthetically pleasing (lol!). Like all the other reviewers have said the mouse is also just super ergonomic, it is probably one of the most comfortable gaming accessories I have ever used. If you are on a budget but need a new gaming mouse this is definitely a great option.For the price, quality and level of customer service I would definitely buy again and recommend to any of my friends who are considering a customize-able gaming mouse.Update: Two years later and this mouse is still working great. I havent had any issues with ghosting or dpi like some other users have mentioned. I would highly encourage any users with these issues to contact the manufacturer to see about a replacement, every once in a while there will be a lemon.Update 5 Years Later:I have been regularly using this mouse every day for five years now with zero problems, I am actually really surprised. The cable has held up well, and I'm considering replacing it with the same model just because mine has gotten kind of gunky and gross from so many years of use. Still love this mouse.Update July 2021:I did end up purchasing a new one, but unfortunately the drivers are broken and don't recognize the mouse when you go into the customization software. Luckily my old mouse still works so when I plugged it back in, all of my settings were still saved on the old mouse which means this is an issue with the new model. In researching this issue seems to have been going on for a few months now, I hope they fix it soon. It does work as a normal mouse, but if you're buying it for it's intended purpose (gaming) you won't be able to change the settings to fit your preferred keybinds/button configurations. Very disappointed and contemplating returning and waiting to see if a new version comes out."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Darlen", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nAmazing Mouse", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2017", "purchased": "Color: Black", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I received this mouse about a week ago and have been using it every day since then. Here are my thoughts on this very budget-friendly device:Honestly, I see people making up excuses that this mouse is good \"for the price.\" Even if this mouse was worth 50 dollars, it'd still be a fair price.-Packaging:The mouse came in simple, straight-forward packaging. A picture of the product on the front, accompanied by flames surrounding the mouse. I honestly thought it was cute, how they still tried to make a good impression while still spending most of the money on the mouse and not the packaging(you throw that away, anyway). The package has a door-like opening, so you remove the little circle tape and open it. There, you see the mouse behind a sheet of plastic. I forgot how, but I think you then slide out the bottom cardboard and remove the mouse and everything else. The braided cable comes tied up with a velcro strap, a nice touch in case you needed to keep it tied up on-the-go. Just a little something I wanted to add: it was cute how they taped the magnets into the box to keep the little \"door\" closed. Nothing wrong about saving money, and it was a little funny tbh.-Mouse:Okay, let me just say that the mouse is amazing. The 16400 DPI is obviously overkill unless you like to get freaky at low sensitivity in games. The mouse is, I think, designed for people with a palm grip, which was no problem for me since that's my regular grip. Either way, the shape of the mouse could get anyone used to the palm grip quite easily. If you do stick with the claw grip, though, I'm afraid you're going to be a little more uncomfortable using the rapid-fire button. Speaking of which, this button is more useful than I first thought it would be. You can set it to click as many times as you want, and it's got a few speed options. I've used it a lot more than I thought I would, and it's very easy to click. However, if you're not used to mouses like these, you'll get confused at first. When I started using the mouse, I would position my finger over the quick-fire on purpose, but for some reason this led me to trying to click the very much appreciated index finger rest, which is very comfortable. Of course, this was just me defeating old habits and in 3 days' time, the mouse buttons' positions came naturally to me. Still waiting for a good opportunity to use the side buttons but they're not a nuisance if you don't use them. The rest at the bottom is appreciated and I actually rest my thumb against the buttons thanks to their angling(which fits the thumb's own form). Also, the mouse has a nice texture to it. Almost like rubberized plastic. It feels nice :) In the packaging, they also included replacement TEFLON pads from 3M, which is appreciated. Or maybe they're the actual TEFLON pads, who knows. The mouse is fine so, yeah.The weight tuning is pretty straight forward. You flip the mouse over, turn the little compartment, and then pop the tray out. I have to say, I'm a heavy mouse guy, but I still thought that having all the weights in was a little too much. On the other hand, removing all the weights made the mouse very, very light. You also get a nice storage tray for the weights you're not using, so that's always a plus. Your macros and everything are saved onto the mouse itself, and you can switch through 5 different profiles, each with its own light color, macro setup, and DPI levels, via a button at the bottom of the mouse. This means you won't be needing software to use the mouse on a new computer unless you want to edit these profiles. The DPI buttons are very accessible to the point where you can switch mid-game. Lighting was pretty straight-forward. You can pick out preset colors or choose your own via a hex color thing. I've seen people have a different color for the scroll wheel than for the rest of the mouse, but I'm not interested in knowing how this works. The lighting isn't a nuisance. You can set to breathing or static, and neither gets annoying(you have your hands covering them the whole time, anyway). The mouse was made to impress, though, hence the cool little lights at the front. They're definitely made to be shown off in LAN parties or anywhere where other people can see your mouse. Otherwise you'd have to stick your face in front of your mouse to see it. They do light up very nicely and there's no crappy lighting.-Software:Installation was fairly easy and fast. They included a little installation disc but I just downloaded the software from their website. It was pretty easy to find. I see people saying the software is clunky, but honestly, it's just like the majority of peripheral software out there minus the over-the-top design schemes. I mean, the software is pretty basic so you can edit your settings faster. You click on the profile you want to edit(the profiles are all at the bottom, numbered), and the settings instantly change to that profile. You have three useful tabs at the top. General, DPI, and Lighting. Both are very straight forward and simple to use. General contains button settings. Macros, quick-fire, right and left clicks, scroll wheel. All of that is edited through there. You can change your scroll speed, polling rate, double-click speed, pointer speed, and acceleration if you're into that. In the DPI section you'll find, surprisingly, the DPI settings. It's very straight forward. It lists each DPI level, from 1-5. You can adjust both the X and Y axis of each DPI level, in case you want to move faster sideways than vertically or the other way around. However, it brings the option to keep X and Y locked so they move parallel to each other. You can set your DPI to a minimum of 50, in case you want to use an entire desk to scroll through half your screen(I just tested this and now idk what my old DPI setting was ffs). Anyway, I attached a screenshot so you can see what this looks like. Now, the lighting section looks pretty straight forward. You can choose the breathing speed(or don't), brightness, and lighting color. Each profile can have a different color.I forgot to add this up by the mouse section, but I saw people complaining about Avago sensors and Omron switches. The Avago sensor in this thing is perfectly fine, with no acceleration(unless you set it up yourself in the software). It doesn't move on its own and if it does, run your anti-virus because that's not the mouse. I also don't see why people complain about Omron switches. They're used in almost every mouse you'll ever own, and there's nothing wrong with them. They're not loud, but they're not quiet so you still get some feedback. Someone also said that even if they rest their finger on the mouse, they'll accidentally click? I asked someone with very, very big and thick hands to use the mouse and they laid their hands on the mouse to test this, and they didn't click. I also saw in another review that the scroll wheel apparently was too loose? The scroll wheel has some arrow heads and is made out of rubber(with plastic on the sides for the lighting). It's tactile enough to let you know that you scrolled it, and if you want to scroll little by little, the resistance is more than enough to stop you.Welp, I think that's all. If I don't update this anymore after a while, it means it's still working perfectly fine."}

It does exactly what i desire it to do when i game as well browse and work well with my one handed keyboard. Things to note about this mouse that some reviews havent really gone to is the texture of the mouse. It like a soft bubbly feel like worn down sandpaper which is a bit uncomfortable but you will get use to it as well give you nice grip to the mouse. The side button, fire button and the dpi button are your everyday plastic texture feel as well the button are tilted inward so you can tell where your thumb is pressed against as wellit press downward so no chance  of jamming. One like to note is the dpi button lean abit toward the other dpi button when pressed instead of a downward motion (must be just my mouse) so keep in mind of accidentally placing something heavy on the dpi button to prevent jamming it. Lastly the scroll wheel isnt free moving instead it stop when you stop moving it but the there isnt no clicking just the feel of it stopping.Before i go into tips bare in mind that macros are a bit of gray zone when it comes to mmo and other online game aspects thing like automation macro (where you click a button and a sequence of skills happen or have a skill on loop) will get you banned. Only macro that are allowed is1. Singular keybind of the side button so button 1 can be something like G for guild or have it as 9 that have a skill.2. Quick cast or one step process where instead of shift + 1 or 1 + left click you can make a macro where it make the two step process one step process (only one skill is allowed per button)Tips:1. You can change the keybinding of the fire button next to your leftclick to a different keybinding- examples being the copy command where you can just double left click a link to highlight it then press the button instead of ctrl + c or manual right clicking to browse copy. Another good keybinding is have on your fire button is your movement speed skill or a buff you usually use so it be a go to while you move.2. You can turn off all dpi beside one on a profile - when you use your dpi button on one profile it stay the same color and only thing change is the red meter so what i do is i choose one of the dpi (1-5 choose 1 if you dont want the red meter and either 2-5 if you want to have a certain meter.2-5. You can keybind one of your dpi button as changed profile - adding onto previous tip, you can have all 5 profiles have one button to change profile as well have their own unique dpi based on game or what your currently doing as well you dont have to turn your mouse over to change profile -note: at the moment i dont think you can disable profiles to only have a certain amount and also when you change profiles it 1,2,3,4,5 so you cant do profile 1 , profile 2 then back to 1 i tried.3. Have your side button be skills on furthest keys - majority of players tend to use 1-6 and buttons around it as well ctrl, alt and shift to keep your hand on WASD or reach toward 0,-, = for things like mounts or potions. Instead of doing that keybind your side button to one of them to maintain your movement as well limit your hand leaving WASD or using your mouse left click to click it.4. Mouse only WASD - Say your lazy or you need to eat or need to do homework. You can keybind 1 as WA, 2 as W 3 as WD, 4 as A 5 as S and 6 as D (and if you can also do S backmotion as well). It pretty helpful but can be abit overwhelming on a single hand but the option is there for your use.5. Button are great for tank players - when it comes to weapons tanks have to swap weapons but usually they are 1h and offhand so you cant exactly place the weapon into your hotbar and expect quick change compare to 2h wielding players where they just click one button and easy swap as well good amount of mmos dont support having same keybinding for two they usually unbind the other. So instead have a side button have two pressed where it click a key that hold your shield and another that hold your sword making it a single presses.5-5. Add more situationial weapon combo - you can be more creative and do stuff like have 4 kind of shield on 1-3, 4-6 , 7-9,10-12 then 3 1h weapon on (1,4,7,10) , (2,5,8,11),(3,6,9,12) so you can do singular swap or entirely different swap.(Note that 5 and 5-5 is in the gray zone and dont go all crazy on it in making a marco where you swap your entire armor set and skill set since it can be considered automation)6. Side buttons are great for support/healers in 5 man party - there always three ways to target a party member. Left clicking your ally avatar, left clicking the party member interface or using F1-F5. Personally as a healer main i hate using F1-F5 (even though it very helpful) since there some keyboards where F is away from the main key so i cast or channel a spell then i click on a different button so i dont lack in my role and as well laptop having their sound and play button on it so it doesnt work so you have to keybind the party member button elsewhere or disable the feature. So what i love about this mouse is i can keybind the party member 1-5 to the side buttons without any form of delay in my healing output.(This also help me greatly in league of legend since you have to hold the key to keep your camara locked to your allies this help me place my redemption much more easier since the transition to ally camara is instant without the need to unlock my camera everytime to do so or using the map as well it allowed me to continue using my skills without having my hand covering the skills briefly as well it gave me the idea of what my ally see on their screen so i understand my position towards my ally. Lastly it great since you can place your shield, heal or buff more consistently when your allies are cluster together since the one you want to target is in the center of your screen)"}

Normally I go logitech and bought the \"G604 LIGHTSPEED\" because my G602 was feeling its age (side buttons wouldn't respond, middle click was finicky).  At first I was pleased by the improvements they had made to it despite a few caveats.  But then I found it didn't work with the good old fashioned Logitech Gaming Software for settin up macros, it totally disregarded the G604s presence, so I had to try the new \"Logitch X\" or whatever it's called.  Absolutely horrid interface, caused conflicts left and right, and didn't allow the old LGS to launch.  So I sent a long berating feedback to logitech to which I never received a reply.  So I uninstalled the new trashware and LGS became unblocked and I dragged on with the 602, cleaned it out, opened up, did the best I could, but there was only so much I could do.  So I putzed around for a few months until I noticed this came up on special.  BETTER than the G602 AND G604.  button-press switch actuation is clear and clean, emits a decided click with tactile feedback of the switch actuation.  The software is SIMPLE, I can't emphasize that part enough, the software isn't perfect but's incredibly light weight and doesn't interfere with LGS.  Only issues are: (1) the DPI up/down buttons throw up a \"toast\" information window which steals focus and seams to be impossible to disable, and (2) figuring out how to make macros behave correctly wasn't as intuitive as LGS.  But once that's out of the way it's damn near perfect.  Longevity will be the next hurdle; it has only been in use for two weeks now, but screw LG and their new horrible software you nave no option about and forget the 100+ dollar mice.  This thing is ready to go.  Also, as for the internal rechargeable battery, if it's on eco mode (no LEDs HOW WILL I SURVIVE WITH OUT MY LE-) the only leds that light are the DPI indicators and it seems to have a MUCH longer life span on eco mode than advertised, even leaving it on over several days."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Luke Chen", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nVenus Pro vs G600?", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020", "purchased": "Color: classic black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I recently purchased the Venus Pro as an alternative to the Logitech G600, which I've used exclusively for the past 5 years. The reason for my switch was because of the G600 - one of my mouse's microswitch was worn out after 5 years, so I purchased a new one. The new one ended up having problems with the side buttons where they activated automatically, so I returned it. In the mean time, I used a spare that I had, which was probably around 4 years old and barely had any use on it but somehow also had its microswitch worn out (this was not a PC issue since the problem occurred on both my desktop and laptop). This made me think that the G600 had some planned obsolescence to it and made me look for an alternative.So here I am today with a new mouse. I purchased this one because of the side buttons, which are very similar to the G600 and I will be comparing some features between the Venus Pro and the G600 because I feel that is probably what people are looking for. Note that some of the cons are simply comparisons between the Venus and the G600 - not that it is necessarily a bad thingVenus:Exteriors Pros- It just feels nice; there is somewhat of a grainy texture on the left and right mouse button that gives some friction. Personally, I like it and think it would feel good during heavy gaming sessions where your fingers are sweating a little bit.- The RGB is fully customizeable through their program (same as G600). There is the option to turn on the mouse without RGB lights to save battery power.- There is the option to go wireless! I cannot confirm how long the battery life is, but from other reviewers it seems like about 3 days of heavy use.- Length of the cord is decently long but is about a full mouse length shorter than the G600.- Comes with a nice bag for travel purposes- Weight is good, similar to G600.Exterior Cons- The side buttons don't \"feel\" as nice as the G600. The venus has smoother side buttons with less distinct ridges, especially with 10-12. I do think this is a big issue since the side buttons are very important in an MMO, especially if you're playing competitively. Pressing the Venus side buttons is also a little more stiff.- BIG CON: the Venus has a little hole to attach the wireless USB dongle. However, when putting that dongle into the mouse, it elevates the mouse and thus causes the laser to malfunction preventing smooth movement or even movement of the mouse entirely. I don't know why they made it this way. If I wanted to play with a wired mouse or play while charging the mouse, then I'd still have to keep the dongle in my USB port or risk losing it somewhere.- They came with sticker padding to put on the under side of the mouse, but using those stickers produces the same problem as the one listed above. Are they supposed to be back up for if the original padding gets destroyed? I guess it's not so much a con as it is a ???.Functionality Pros- There are 13 fully customizeable buttons, 16 if you include the right, left, and middle mouse button. I think for the average user, this should be more than enough, but more details are below in the cons- You can create macros in their program (same as G600 program)- You can adjust 5 levels of DPI, which can be adjusted on the fly using the arrow buttons on the mouse right underneath the scroll wheel. You can also adjust the mouse sensitivity, scrolling speed, an double-click speed in their programFunctionality Cons- As I mentioned before, the average user should have no problem utilizing 13 extra buttons on a mouse - most do not need any more. I personally like having more and have used them in MMO's like World of Warcraft. The G600 offers a \"g-shift\" button, which is a \"click and hold\" feature to the right of its right mouse button that, when held down, changes the whole key settings/bindings, thus allowing buttons 1-12 (+7 of its own) buttons to be bound to other commands. As I mentioned, this probably isn't a big deal to the average MMO user.- A functionality issue that I particularly dislike though is that the DPI buttons cannot be assigned to something else. On my G600, I have those assigned and use them often as I don't need to change my DPI for anything.- The G600 offers a way to tilt the mouse scroll wheel to the left or right with the default command being \"back\" and \"forward\", which I use frequently. The venus does not offer this ability with its scroll wheel, although it can be assigned to one of its 12 side buttons.- The UI of the venus program is not nearly as nice as compared to the Logitech Gaming Software. But to be fair, I believe LGS was supposedly shifted over in favor of some new program called Logitech Hub or something of the sort? I used it once and hated it and went back to LGS.Overall I think for the price and for the average user, it is and can be a great mouse. The comparable mouse on the market would be the G600, which at full price is a little more than 150% the cost of this mouse at full price (G600 $79.99 vs Venus $49.99), however most of the time I've found the G600 to be on sale with my cheapest purchase at around $23 and average at $49. Due to my recent frustrations with the G600 in the microswitches and side button malfunction, I'm wary to recommend that mouse now. But time will tell with the Venus in terms of its quality compared to the G600. I've purchased another G600 for my main desktop since the lack in buttons for my MMO's on the Venus just won't cut it and I've relegated the Venus for my laptop use."}

The buttons are just the right size to click with your thumb and the pressure needed to press them make them easy enough to press in tense moments while also making mistakes fairly rare. I use the back of my thumb to press the last column and this even works pretty well. The rapid fire button feels quite nice to press as well. The scroll wheel is segmented but also smooth.Minor complaints include the fact that I am not a huge fan of the sandpaper feel on the left/right buttons and on the edge. In particular, I found that my ring/pinky fingers started to feel chafed by it when first using it, though I believe use of the device quickly wore it in and I no longer get this feeling. I do also wish the thumb rest was extended a bit further out from the mouse. I do not use it that often, but it is not really wide enough to fit the entire thumb without it hanging off the edge.I love that the mouse is wireless, as I could never get used to the cord snag that occurs with wired models, though it can also be used with a wire if that is your preference. The battery life is superb. I can forget to charge it for days at a time and it will still have juice. The sleep mode activates pretty quickly after not using the mouse for a period of time and will automatically awaken after any movement/button presses and will register said input.The two DPI buttons are placed in a nice spot and there are four red lights, or the absence of light, which indicate five different profiles. These are set to 1000/2000/4000/8000/16000 by default, but you can set them to whatever your preference is. As I find any lights on my mouse/keyboard distracting, I set my preferred DPI on the lowest profile. That said, the RGB lights on the mouse are great. The thumb buttons look particularly cool when it is shining through them. If you want to show off a cool new mouse, this is the one for you.The program for this mouse is also pretty great and easy to understand. The default profile for the thumb buttons sets them to 1-0 on the number row and -/+ on the number pad. I'm not sure why they decided to use the numpad rather than the number row for the last two, as I have played games which contain item slots on the latter number row keys, though they are easily remappable in the program or in-game. The program allows for importing/exporting profiles, which is necessary if using more than two. The profile switch button on the bottom can cycle between the default, which is itself remappable, and an imported profile. The program also allows the user to design macros which is very convenient for the sake of productivity.For gaming, the number row mapping already makes perfect sense for many games. Even though I do not really play MMO games, I found that being able to swap weapons in GTA and items/shouts in Skyrim with the touch of a button was quite an improvement over using the number row, which takes fingers that could be pressing other keys and has an inconveniently placed second half for the left hand to reach. Of course, you can feel free to map it to whichever buttons you want.I also personally use this for video editing and general productivity shortcuts on my PC and I can report that it is excellent for both. My left hand has to move around far less than what it used to, and overall things feel more balanced. Overall extremely pleased with my decision to purchase this mouse and recommend it to anyone who wants a versatile instrument for any of a multitude of computing needs.EDIT: I have dropped this review to four stars because of an issue with the scroll wheel. After having the mouse on for some time the scroll wheel takes two notches to start scrolling in the opposite direction (for instance, if I am scrolling down and I try to scroll up the first notch on the wheel that is scrolled up will do nothing). If I turn the mouse off and then on again it will return to normal, but will, in time, begin to act up again. It is rather minor, but is quite annoying. And I can see this being a detriment in games. I have reached out to Utech's support and have not gotten a response. I am trying again. If my issue is resolved I will return the review to five stars.EDIT: I managed to get in contact with them through the email for the gift inside the box. They were very nice and sent me a new one. While the second one was on the way, my original somehow started working again. I can only surmise that it has something to do with being kept on for a long enough period of time, rather than being turned off and on again after acting up. Anyhow, I am pleased that it has started working again and that I now have a backup in case it messes up once more, and am now raising it back to five stars!"}

I use a kind of a broad claw grip and prefer it when the butt of the mouse rests in the palm of my hand, which this does comfortably while still leaving my fingers well positioned on the buttons. It's also remarkably comfortable, almost as if it was designed with my hand specifically in mind. Obviously your mileage may vary on this one but the at rest position for the third (ring) finger on my hand is well placed, with just the right bit of additional contour to aid in gripping the mouse when lifting it. In addition the descending curve of the side allows my pinky finger to rest against the mouse, partially touching, instead of awkwardly dangling in space as with so many mice, while at the same time allowing me to feel a bit of the pad below so I can judge distance precisely. I cannot over-emphasize how pleasant this is to hold an d use.The action on the scroll wheel is not too stiff nor so soft that I fear accidentally scrolling. The wheel is a straight two axis forward/backward with a distinct rest at each stop (no free spinning here) which is just as I like it. Since there's no tilt wheel there's no risk of accidental presses from the first and second fingers at rest or while scrolling, but the wide position of the buttons is such that this frame could accommodate a four axis scroll wheel without trouble. The action on button1 and button2 is unremarkable and adequate, quite average and nothing worth mentioning. There is an additional button to the left of button1 which is well positioned and is not at risk of accidental pressing, is easily found by touch, and easy to click at will. The DPI control buttons in the top center are raised and sufficiently stiff that there is essentially zero chance of accidental adjustment even during furious use. There are four DPI settings and LEDs clearly indicate which is chosen at any given moment.On the thumb side is a 12 button num bearing the digits 0-9 which act as num keys as well as \"minus\" on 11 and \"plus\" on 12. I had thought that having so many buttons on the side where the thumb rests would either make accidentally depressing them hard or deliberately pressing them hard, and in any case detract from the ability to grip, move, and lift the mouse but this turns out not to be the case. My thumb can rest such that I can with grip the forward edge of the button enclosure--and do so as firmly as I like--without any accidental clicks.  Rocking the thumb back and working by feel makes it fairly easy to click most--but not all--of the keys. I find 1-3 and  7-9 to be easy, 10-12 to be awkward, and 4-6 to be somewhat difficult without accidentally also depressing buttons on adjacent rows. This is far better than I anticipated and leaves me with a gratifyingly large number of buttons available at a twitch.I am a bit disappointed not to find a more usual thumb button on the side forward from the num pad buttons. It seems that there is sufficient space for one and such a button would fit nicely with my grip style, where the num pad position does not. It's not an insurmountable problem to move my thumb back for clicks but forward would be far more compatible with my grip. I suspect the designers anticipate a grip where the thumb rests naturally in the middle of the num pad with the pad of the thumb on the \"5\" key; indeed, in this position clicking all of the buttons does become easier. Still, I am not about to adapt my style to fit a mouse!There are adjustable weights but honestly the difference between empty and filled is not very much. I prefer it with all weights added (because I like my mice heavy) but I fear that if you prefer a feather-weight mouse even with all removed you will not be satisfied.A toggle button on the bottom cycles through five different LED colors. I understand that each color also corresponds to a (configurable) macro set, and certainly each remembers it DPI setting independently. Unfortunately the control software for this mouse is not compatible with Linux and I have not found a working way to alter the mouse behavior on Linux. This is, for me, a deal breaker, because I can't control which key codes are emitted when I use the thumb buttons--and since they correspond by default to keyboard keys I in effect have only three extra buttons on this mouse despite the 16 it has by appearance. The right click button is button2, and the mouse wheel button3, both as usual, but the left click button and the extra button next it are both button1. Since all of the thumb buttons emit by default not \"button\" events but regular key events I am obliged to either redo my RPG keybinding layout to accommodate that or suffer redundancy. I could remap the thumb buttons in to hard-to-each keyboard keys that I don't use for anything now, but this is tedious and irritating.  Still, this is not an issue on a platform supported by the manufacturer so I'm only knocking off one star from the review rather than the 3 that this problem really deserves. For most people this will not at all be an issue.Because of the above problem I did not review the macro capability of them mouse, which is purportedly one of its main selling points. Even without that feature there is a lot to like here: inexpensive, nice and large, comfortable grip, nice action, good weight and feel. For non-gaming and light gaming use I have no problem using this mouse, but for serious gaming where more buttons means more power I can't personally consider it.If I figure out a convenient way to control macros from Linux, or if I find a good way even to remap the key events in to button events, I will report back here and raise the rating."}

First time I've had a wireless mouse with the buttons on the side AND LED lights on it, so I'm decently surprised at how often I can go between charges. I'm not sure if I'm quite getting 70 hours of time out of it, as I can't tell how charged it is or if it is fully charged as the LED that comes on when you plug it in, does not turn off until unplugged. The mouse wheel is a little \"chunky\" feeling? If that makes sense? It kinda feels like whatever turns under the scroll wheel is rusted or might have something on it. Though this could be damage from the driver who unfortunately decided to chuck it over my fence, instead of placing it on my porch, so I can excuse this fault.The only issue I really have with this mouse, is that the software is a little confusing to understand. It looks A LOT like the Red Dragon brand of mouse i've used before, but, since this mouse can program the buttons on the side to do more than one input at a time (you could have 1 button do ctrl+alt+delete) it says Key Combinations instead of \"change Key input\" or something along those lines which threw me off the first time, especially because it didnt come with a manual lol.TL;DR/Overall, I would say this a reliable mouse and is a pretty good budget mouse for things like World of Warcraft (what I use it for)"}

Anyways, I've dropped the review down to three stars because this mouse is just \"average.\" You can't hold down the button next to the LMB and press another button on the side, i.e. binding top button to Ctrl and pressing a side button to double the amount of button presses.As previously mentioned, you cannot remap the DPI buttons whatsoever.The wired mouse's software is much more in-depth and lets you do all of these things, from what I've researched.After using this mouse for several weeks, the side buttons are no longer consistent in feel and sound. Some buttons are still tactile, while others are almost silent and mushy. The right click feels much softer than the left click, to the point where I almost don't realize I've pushed it. The only saving grace for this mouse at this point is the fact that it's wireless. I won't be returning the mouse as it's not worth the hassle, but I'm definitely going to just stick with a Logitech G600. For the price of the wire, I can enjoy double the button presses with everything being customizable. And it's cheaper a majority of the time.The pouch it includes is nice, and I'll definitely use that. The mouse is not a bad mouse, it's just not exactly what I need for my playstyle. Like I said, it's just average. I knew getting into this that I couldn't remap the DPI buttons, but when I found out about the lack of multi-button support and the wired mouse's counterpart having much more in-depth software...I was very disappointed. I really feel like the issues I've come across are software related, but I don't foresee a software update coming anytime soon for these mice.*****Original Review Below*****Please UtechSmart, let us remap the two buttons under the scroll wheel! I personally never change my DPI once I set it via software, but having the option to use the buttons for something more functional would be nice! Pleeeeease. I know there are several other reviews mentioning this. Those two perfectly good buttons are unused otherwise. Created macros also do not show up in the macro list when attempting to assign them to a key. Because of these two easily fixable software issues that have STILL not been updated, I've docked a star.As for the actual mouse, it's great! First impressions, I was definitely pleased to see a carrying pouch and a detachable braided USB-C cable. I bought this mouse as a substitute for my G600 while I travel, as there is no wireless version of the G600 yet. The driver software is included via a very snazzy looking business card that flips out into a baby USB drive. It does the win+r command and types in a command to open a Dropbox with the software files.The buttons themselves are alright, they'll definitely do the job. The scroll wheel is good, though I wish it tilted like my G600 too. But as that's a hardware thing, I can accept that tradeoff for wireless connectivity. Clicks are not offensively loud like some mice, which I'm definitely grateful for as I'll be using this while traveling. However, the side buttons are a bit audible, much louder than the G600, but still not terrible. (If you have a Nintendo Switch, the side buttons sound similar to pressing the face buttons on the joycons.) The finish on the mouse is...different than I'm used to. But it's not bad, just a bit textured. It's not smooth like a G600 or a Naga, but more like a soft sandpaper, if you will. The entire mouse feels like that except for the shiny section in the middle where your palm rests, and the side buttons. There's a spot under the mouse to store the tiny USB dongle, and it's magnetic rather than snapping in. A very nice touch as I have short fingernails and trying to pry something like that out would be a nightmare.I also enjoy the resting spot for your ring finger, and although it's not a button like my G600, it's still second nature for me to have a finger there. The third clicking button I use on my G600 was just moved to the left of the left mouse button, which I am perfectly fine with. It's not a bad placement and I can easily reach it plus all twelve of the side buttons, effectively doubling the button inputs.Getting onto the software, it's...usable. When I first installed it, I could not for the life of me get the colors on the mouse to change. And as I was searching for the solution, suddenly about 15 or so minutes later, the lights just started cooperating. Very odd. It works flawlessly now so I have no complaints, just confusion.The software lets you choose what buttons you want to use, but you have to choose the option \"Key Combination\" and just press the key without any modifiers in order to do so. Just in case anyone has any confusion like I did at first.The lighting is all one color, no per-key RGB here. Which is fine, my G600 is the same. I do enjoy the amount of lights though! The scroll wheel illumination is very nice, and the logo illumination is bright. However, the lights on the front of the mouse seem to be different colors between the three grills on either side, which isn't a big deal to me personally.Mapping keys (once I figured it out) was quick, changing the DPI setting via software and disabling the other DPI profiles (hence, making those buttons useless) was painless.I'm grateful the software allows macros, but I couldn't get them to show up in the macro list when I tried to assign them to a key, which, like the DPI buttons, makes them useless.TL;DRPros:The mouse comes with a nice pouch and braided USB-C cable.Feels good to use, a decent wireless substitute to the G600.Mapping keys was quick and painless.Lights are bright and seem to be fairly accurate. (Note: You cannot change the four lights next to the DPI buttons, so I turn mine off.)Mouse weighs similar to a G600.Cons:THE SOFTWARE. Seriously. Please, let me remap the DPI buttons just like the side buttons (which the wired version allows) and let me have the ability to use my macros. If I knew coding and could fix it myself, I absolutely would.Literally the only things wrong with this mouse are software related. I don't understand why these issues haven't been fixed. If you can have a fancy business card that runs an entire string of code to download software, why can't said software be fixed?"}

I use the 12X side buttons on Razer (why would you include 3 side to increase the price and they are cluttered in the drawer) so I duplicated the button assignment.  They work well and due to my experience with the other mouse it was easy to reassign all the buttons.  There was a bit of nomenclature difference so just a little stumble but ok.  The mouse worked similar to Razer and will buy more after few more days.With Razer I have to download  a large software to have the mouse working but with Utech (wired) the directory size is 11.6 Mb Vs 948Mb for Razer.  (Geez, Give me a break!)  I was surprised to find that just a driver was able to do this.  I attached the screenshot for FYI.Now I have not used it much, only 1 day, so I will update as time goes.  I did have an event when I clicked one of the buttons, it went to \"Show Desktop\" which is one of the buttons programmed.  This could be that I am not used to the mouse.  I will see if this happens or if other buttons misbehave.  Too early to tell.This is for the Utech people or others on my thoughts:- The USB connector is long compared to Razer so it sticks out.  I think being shorter does not detract from the function so should be shorter.- The cord is much thicker and stiffer so I was a bit disappointed.  This also should be able to be smaller and softer.- The \"Fire\" button next to the left click is nice extra and works as an \"enter / double click\" but for me it would be much better if it was about 1/4 inch or 6 mm closer to my finger so it can be clicked easier.  I honestly do not think it will interfere with left clicking- The clicking pressure is a bit more that Razer but I am sure I will get used to it.- I like the \"Thumb rest\" but would be better if it was raised  about 3 mm the thumb is already closer to the buttons.  The buttons have some pressure resistance so this would not be a issue with accidental clicking.  I put a silicone foam pad to raise it and have more comfort.- The slant on the right side of the mouse can be more vertical so I can pick up the mouse with my thumb and 3rd finger in case you want to.  This would not interfere with molding the case.  I put another foam pad to aid in comfort and friction but due to curvature, pad is lifting off.- There is a \"tactile rise\" on the 5th and the 8th button but I would have preferred it a bit higher.  Although it is there, I could not feel it much.  They did put some thought into it so this is good.  Razer does not have it so even after years of use I sometime look down.So far this is it.  I like to add some follow up after more use."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "IvyX", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nUpdated review for Wireless Version", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2016", "purchased": "Color: Black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Wireless Version Review:After many years, it was finally time to replace my beloved wired Venus gaming mouse. The left click button was consistently double clicking when I only clicked once, but after 7 years everything else was still working great including all the other buttons and profiles in the software. Unfortunately when I bought the same mouse last year, the software and drivers no longer work and made using the profiles and changing settings in the UtechSmart application impossible. I decided to go back to my old (although dysfunctional) one and this year decided to try the wireless version.Set up was surprisingly easy given how much trouble I had last time, I really like how the software and drivers come on a usb flashdrive now instead of on the website or a mini disc. This ensures you have some drivers that should make the mouse work in it's most basic iteration. It worked as soon as I plugged it in, and the flash drive as well. You can only have two profiles with the wireless version (and switch between then using the button on the bottom of the mouse), but all the buttons are still programmable and you can the light settings on the mouse or turn them off entirely if you don't like the feature or want to save battery, and you can do this on both the app or the mouse itself. The light also goes into sleep mode until you move it again if you don't use it for awhile but leave the mouse on. One thing I don't like is that I think it was easier to program the buttons in the old version, now you have to use macros multi-key input if you want to set hotkeys for buttons that aren't already in it's drop down menu.The buttons and scroll wheel feel as nice as I expected. The side buttons are a little less mushy than the wired version, but to be honest that never bothered me much. I don't play competitive games and like having a mouse like this for MMO's and sandbox games like Ark that have a lot of actions that we can hotkey. Overall I think this mouse will still fit my needs and I have always loved the design. The only other mouse I've ever seen that was similar is by Razr but their products have always felt really cheap for how expensive they are. This mouse is half the price and feels a lot nicer. The slightly rubberized texture feels nice in the hand and wears well over time. The curve is very ergonomic for my average to smallish sized hands. I'm really happy to have found a version that still works for me.Below is my original review for the wired version from 2015, not sure it combines them and I'm unable to write a separate/new review.I have been using this mouse for about 10 months. I'm not sure when exactly but at some point it started to turn off and on if I accidentally bumped the USB part of the cable when it was plugged in. For the longest time I thought it was just my computer's USB port (the mouse and cable itself still look physically perfect and I took very good care of it) but over the last few weeks it started to do it quite frequently when even just moving the mouse and eventually it stopped turning on all together when plugged in. At that point I realized it had been the cord all along as it would not turn on no matter what USB port I plugged it into. I had purchased an extended warranty when I bought the mouse but when I called the provider they directed me to contact the manufacturer first as they offer an 18 month warranty. It was a bit difficult to find any contact information on the UtechSmart website (and all I did find was an email address) but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service I received in response. They responded within 24 hours (they were more responsive at night which I thought was a bit weird but this worked well with my schedule) and after a few email questions back and forth over the next business day agreed to send me a replacement. The replacement was sent within one business day and was sent with One Day shipping. Needless to say I was very happy as I had already been without a working mouse for my gaming for a few days.The new mouse seems to be working perfectly but there are a few differences I've noticed from the first one I received 10 months ago that I think are worth noting. The braided cord feels more durable now, the profile color selection now changes the scroll button glow as well, and the texture of the mouse itself has changed. Previously it had a smooth grip texture which I really liked but the new one has a rough/grainy texture which caught me off guard at first. After a few hours I actually came to like it better than the smooth grip the mouse had before.I have read some of the previous views as well and wanted to comment on the mouse and software itself. I have never used a Razer mouse but based on a previous experience with their products and some feedback from my friends I have never been impressed with their quality or durability (a console controller should not break after two months of normal use). I don't really play competitive online games but this mouse has been great for the games I do play (Dragon Age, Rebel Galaxy, Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, etc). I wanted a quality mouse with tons of side buttons to make it easier to get to and use a lot of skills quickly. This mouse has worked out perfectly for that.Yes, the buttons may be considered a bit squishy compared to some of the name brand mice as they are not mechanical but the keys are easy to reach and work well, after a few hours your thumb develops the muscle memory to use the side buttons without issue. Yes, you may not have quite as much control over the settings as you would with one of the name brand mice. However there are still tons of settings you do have control over and I found the software very intuitive and easy to use (especially considering I have not had much experience using these settings in the past). I love the glow feature because it helps me remember to change profiles depending on which game I want to play and it's also just aesthetically pleasing (lol!). Like all the other reviewers have said the mouse is also just super ergonomic, it is probably one of the most comfortable gaming accessories I have ever used. If you are on a budget but need a new gaming mouse this is definitely a great option.For the price, quality and level of customer service I would definitely buy again and recommend to any of my friends who are considering a customize-able gaming mouse.Update: Two years later and this mouse is still working great. I havent had any issues with ghosting or dpi like some other users have mentioned. I would highly encourage any users with these issues to contact the manufacturer to see about a replacement, every once in a while there will be a lemon.Update 5 Years Later:I have been regularly using this mouse every day for five years now with zero problems, I am actually really surprised. The cable has held up well, and I'm considering replacing it with the same model just because mine has gotten kind of gunky and gross from so many years of use. Still love this mouse.Update July 2021:I did end up purchasing a new one, but unfortunately the drivers are broken and don't recognize the mouse when you go into the customization software. Luckily my old mouse still works so when I plugged it back in, all of my settings were still saved on the old mouse which means this is an issue with the new model. In researching this issue seems to have been going on for a few months now, I hope they fix it soon. It does work as a normal mouse, but if you're buying it for it's intended purpose (gaming) you won't be able to change the settings to fit your preferred keybinds/button configurations. Very disappointed and contemplating returning and waiting to see if a new version comes out."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Darlen", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nAmazing Mouse", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2017", "purchased": "Color: Black", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I received this mouse about a week ago and have been using it every day since then. Here are my thoughts on this very budget-friendly device:Honestly, I see people making up excuses that this mouse is good \"for the price.\" Even if this mouse was worth 50 dollars, it'd still be a fair price.-Packaging:The mouse came in simple, straight-forward packaging. A picture of the product on the front, accompanied by flames surrounding the mouse. I honestly thought it was cute, how they still tried to make a good impression while still spending most of the money on the mouse and not the packaging(you throw that away, anyway). The package has a door-like opening, so you remove the little circle tape and open it. There, you see the mouse behind a sheet of plastic. I forgot how, but I think you then slide out the bottom cardboard and remove the mouse and everything else. The braided cable comes tied up with a velcro strap, a nice touch in case you needed to keep it tied up on-the-go. Just a little something I wanted to add: it was cute how they taped the magnets into the box to keep the little \"door\" closed. Nothing wrong about saving money, and it was a little funny tbh.-Mouse:Okay, let me just say that the mouse is amazing. The 16400 DPI is obviously overkill unless you like to get freaky at low sensitivity in games. The mouse is, I think, designed for people with a palm grip, which was no problem for me since that's my regular grip. Either way, the shape of the mouse could get anyone used to the palm grip quite easily. If you do stick with the claw grip, though, I'm afraid you're going to be a little more uncomfortable using the rapid-fire button. Speaking of which, this button is more useful than I first thought it would be. You can set it to click as many times as you want, and it's got a few speed options. I've used it a lot more than I thought I would, and it's very easy to click. However, if you're not used to mouses like these, you'll get confused at first. When I started using the mouse, I would position my finger over the quick-fire on purpose, but for some reason this led me to trying to click the very much appreciated index finger rest, which is very comfortable. Of course, this was just me defeating old habits and in 3 days' time, the mouse buttons' positions came naturally to me. Still waiting for a good opportunity to use the side buttons but they're not a nuisance if you don't use them. The rest at the bottom is appreciated and I actually rest my thumb against the buttons thanks to their angling(which fits the thumb's own form). Also, the mouse has a nice texture to it. Almost like rubberized plastic. It feels nice :) In the packaging, they also included replacement TEFLON pads from 3M, which is appreciated. Or maybe they're the actual TEFLON pads, who knows. The mouse is fine so, yeah.The weight tuning is pretty straight forward. You flip the mouse over, turn the little compartment, and then pop the tray out. I have to say, I'm a heavy mouse guy, but I still thought that having all the weights in was a little too much. On the other hand, removing all the weights made the mouse very, very light. You also get a nice storage tray for the weights you're not using, so that's always a plus. Your macros and everything are saved onto the mouse itself, and you can switch through 5 different profiles, each with its own light color, macro setup, and DPI levels, via a button at the bottom of the mouse. This means you won't be needing software to use the mouse on a new computer unless you want to edit these profiles. The DPI buttons are very accessible to the point where you can switch mid-game. Lighting was pretty straight-forward. You can pick out preset colors or choose your own via a hex color thing. I've seen people have a different color for the scroll wheel than for the rest of the mouse, but I'm not interested in knowing how this works. The lighting isn't a nuisance. You can set to breathing or static, and neither gets annoying(you have your hands covering them the whole time, anyway). The mouse was made to impress, though, hence the cool little lights at the front. They're definitely made to be shown off in LAN parties or anywhere where other people can see your mouse. Otherwise you'd have to stick your face in front of your mouse to see it. They do light up very nicely and there's no crappy lighting.-Software:Installation was fairly easy and fast. They included a little installation disc but I just downloaded the software from their website. It was pretty easy to find. I see people saying the software is clunky, but honestly, it's just like the majority of peripheral software out there minus the over-the-top design schemes. I mean, the software is pretty basic so you can edit your settings faster. You click on the profile you want to edit(the profiles are all at the bottom, numbered), and the settings instantly change to that profile. You have three useful tabs at the top. General, DPI, and Lighting. Both are very straight forward and simple to use. General contains button settings. Macros, quick-fire, right and left clicks, scroll wheel. All of that is edited through there. You can change your scroll speed, polling rate, double-click speed, pointer speed, and acceleration if you're into that. In the DPI section you'll find, surprisingly, the DPI settings. It's very straight forward. It lists each DPI level, from 1-5. You can adjust both the X and Y axis of each DPI level, in case you want to move faster sideways than vertically or the other way around. However, it brings the option to keep X and Y locked so they move parallel to each other. You can set your DPI to a minimum of 50, in case you want to use an entire desk to scroll through half your screen(I just tested this and now idk what my old DPI setting was ffs). Anyway, I attached a screenshot so you can see what this looks like. Now, the lighting section looks pretty straight forward. You can choose the breathing speed(or don't), brightness, and lighting color. Each profile can have a different color.I forgot to add this up by the mouse section, but I saw people complaining about Avago sensors and Omron switches. The Avago sensor in this thing is perfectly fine, with no acceleration(unless you set it up yourself in the software). It doesn't move on its own and if it does, run your anti-virus because that's not the mouse. I also don't see why people complain about Omron switches. They're used in almost every mouse you'll ever own, and there's nothing wrong with them. They're not loud, but they're not quiet so you still get some feedback. Someone also said that even if they rest their finger on the mouse, they'll accidentally click? I asked someone with very, very big and thick hands to use the mouse and they laid their hands on the mouse to test this, and they didn't click. I also saw in another review that the scroll wheel apparently was too loose? The scroll wheel has some arrow heads and is made out of rubber(with plastic on the sides for the lighting). It's tactile enough to let you know that you scrolled it, and if you want to scroll little by little, the resistance is more than enough to stop you.Welp, I think that's all. If I don't update this anymore after a while, it means it's still working perfectly fine."}

It does exactly what i desire it to do when i game as well browse and work well with my one handed keyboard. Things to note about this mouse that some reviews havent really gone to is the texture of the mouse. It like a soft bubbly feel like worn down sandpaper which is a bit uncomfortable but you will get use to it as well give you nice grip to the mouse. The side button, fire button and the dpi button are your everyday plastic texture feel as well the button are tilted inward so you can tell where your thumb is pressed against as wellit press downward so no chance  of jamming. One like to note is the dpi button lean abit toward the other dpi button when pressed instead of a downward motion (must be just my mouse) so keep in mind of accidentally placing something heavy on the dpi button to prevent jamming it. Lastly the scroll wheel isnt free moving instead it stop when you stop moving it but the there isnt no clicking just the feel of it stopping.Before i go into tips bare in mind that macros are a bit of gray zone when it comes to mmo and other online game aspects thing like automation macro (where you click a button and a sequence of skills happen or have a skill on loop) will get you banned. Only macro that are allowed is1. Singular keybind of the side button so button 1 can be something like G for guild or have it as 9 that have a skill.2. Quick cast or one step process where instead of shift + 1 or 1 + left click you can make a macro where it make the two step process one step process (only one skill is allowed per button)Tips:1. You can change the keybinding of the fire button next to your leftclick to a different keybinding- examples being the copy command where you can just double left click a link to highlight it then press the button instead of ctrl + c or manual right clicking to browse copy. Another good keybinding is have on your fire button is your movement speed skill or a buff you usually use so it be a go to while you move.2. You can turn off all dpi beside one on a profile - when you use your dpi button on one profile it stay the same color and only thing change is the red meter so what i do is i choose one of the dpi (1-5 choose 1 if you dont want the red meter and either 2-5 if you want to have a certain meter.2-5. You can keybind one of your dpi button as changed profile - adding onto previous tip, you can have all 5 profiles have one button to change profile as well have their own unique dpi based on game or what your currently doing as well you dont have to turn your mouse over to change profile -note: at the moment i dont think you can disable profiles to only have a certain amount and also when you change profiles it 1,2,3,4,5 so you cant do profile 1 , profile 2 then back to 1 i tried.3. Have your side button be skills on furthest keys - majority of players tend to use 1-6 and buttons around it as well ctrl, alt and shift to keep your hand on WASD or reach toward 0,-, = for things like mounts or potions. Instead of doing that keybind your side button to one of them to maintain your movement as well limit your hand leaving WASD or using your mouse left click to click it.4. Mouse only WASD - Say your lazy or you need to eat or need to do homework. You can keybind 1 as WA, 2 as W 3 as WD, 4 as A 5 as S and 6 as D (and if you can also do S backmotion as well). It pretty helpful but can be abit overwhelming on a single hand but the option is there for your use.5. Button are great for tank players - when it comes to weapons tanks have to swap weapons but usually they are 1h and offhand so you cant exactly place the weapon into your hotbar and expect quick change compare to 2h wielding players where they just click one button and easy swap as well good amount of mmos dont support having same keybinding for two they usually unbind the other. So instead have a side button have two pressed where it click a key that hold your shield and another that hold your sword making it a single presses.5-5. Add more situationial weapon combo - you can be more creative and do stuff like have 4 kind of shield on 1-3, 4-6 , 7-9,10-12 then 3 1h weapon on (1,4,7,10) , (2,5,8,11),(3,6,9,12) so you can do singular swap or entirely different swap.(Note that 5 and 5-5 is in the gray zone and dont go all crazy on it in making a marco where you swap your entire armor set and skill set since it can be considered automation)6. Side buttons are great for support/healers in 5 man party - there always three ways to target a party member. Left clicking your ally avatar, left clicking the party member interface or using F1-F5. Personally as a healer main i hate using F1-F5 (even though it very helpful) since there some keyboards where F is away from the main key so i cast or channel a spell then i click on a different button so i dont lack in my role and as well laptop having their sound and play button on it so it doesnt work so you have to keybind the party member button elsewhere or disable the feature. So what i love about this mouse is i can keybind the party member 1-5 to the side buttons without any form of delay in my healing output.(This also help me greatly in league of legend since you have to hold the key to keep your camara locked to your allies this help me place my redemption much more easier since the transition to ally camara is instant without the need to unlock my camera everytime to do so or using the map as well it allowed me to continue using my skills without having my hand covering the skills briefly as well it gave me the idea of what my ally see on their screen so i understand my position towards my ally. Lastly it great since you can place your shield, heal or buff more consistently when your allies are cluster together since the one you want to target is in the center of your screen)"}

Normally I go logitech and bought the \"G604 LIGHTSPEED\" because my G602 was feeling its age (side buttons wouldn't respond, middle click was finicky).  At first I was pleased by the improvements they had made to it despite a few caveats.  But then I found it didn't work with the good old fashioned Logitech Gaming Software for settin up macros, it totally disregarded the G604s presence, so I had to try the new \"Logitch X\" or whatever it's called.  Absolutely horrid interface, caused conflicts left and right, and didn't allow the old LGS to launch.  So I sent a long berating feedback to logitech to which I never received a reply.  So I uninstalled the new trashware and LGS became unblocked and I dragged on with the 602, cleaned it out, opened up, did the best I could, but there was only so much I could do.  So I putzed around for a few months until I noticed this came up on special.  BETTER than the G602 AND G604.  button-press switch actuation is clear and clean, emits a decided click with tactile feedback of the switch actuation.  The software is SIMPLE, I can't emphasize that part enough, the software isn't perfect but's incredibly light weight and doesn't interfere with LGS.  Only issues are: (1) the DPI up/down buttons throw up a \"toast\" information window which steals focus and seams to be impossible to disable, and (2) figuring out how to make macros behave correctly wasn't as intuitive as LGS.  But once that's out of the way it's damn near perfect.  Longevity will be the next hurdle; it has only been in use for two weeks now, but screw LG and their new horrible software you nave no option about and forget the 100+ dollar mice.  This thing is ready to go.  Also, as for the internal rechargeable battery, if it's on eco mode (no LEDs HOW WILL I SURVIVE WITH OUT MY LE-) the only leds that light are the DPI indicators and it seems to have a MUCH longer life span on eco mode than advertised, even leaving it on over several days."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Luke Chen", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nVenus Pro vs G600?", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020", "purchased": "Color: classic black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I recently purchased the Venus Pro as an alternative to the Logitech G600, which I've used exclusively for the past 5 years. The reason for my switch was because of the G600 - one of my mouse's microswitch was worn out after 5 years, so I purchased a new one. The new one ended up having problems with the side buttons where they activated automatically, so I returned it. In the mean time, I used a spare that I had, which was probably around 4 years old and barely had any use on it but somehow also had its microswitch worn out (this was not a PC issue since the problem occurred on both my desktop and laptop). This made me think that the G600 had some planned obsolescence to it and made me look for an alternative.So here I am today with a new mouse. I purchased this one because of the side buttons, which are very similar to the G600 and I will be comparing some features between the Venus Pro and the G600 because I feel that is probably what people are looking for. Note that some of the cons are simply comparisons between the Venus and the G600 - not that it is necessarily a bad thingVenus:Exteriors Pros- It just feels nice; there is somewhat of a grainy texture on the left and right mouse button that gives some friction. Personally, I like it and think it would feel good during heavy gaming sessions where your fingers are sweating a little bit.- The RGB is fully customizeable through their program (same as G600). There is the option to turn on the mouse without RGB lights to save battery power.- There is the option to go wireless! I cannot confirm how long the battery life is, but from other reviewers it seems like about 3 days of heavy use.- Length of the cord is decently long but is about a full mouse length shorter than the G600.- Comes with a nice bag for travel purposes- Weight is good, similar to G600.Exterior Cons- The side buttons don't \"feel\" as nice as the G600. The venus has smoother side buttons with less distinct ridges, especially with 10-12. I do think this is a big issue since the side buttons are very important in an MMO, especially if you're playing competitively. Pressing the Venus side buttons is also a little more stiff.- BIG CON: the Venus has a little hole to attach the wireless USB dongle. However, when putting that dongle into the mouse, it elevates the mouse and thus causes the laser to malfunction preventing smooth movement or even movement of the mouse entirely. I don't know why they made it this way. If I wanted to play with a wired mouse or play while charging the mouse, then I'd still have to keep the dongle in my USB port or risk losing it somewhere.- They came with sticker padding to put on the under side of the mouse, but using those stickers produces the same problem as the one listed above. Are they supposed to be back up for if the original padding gets destroyed? I guess it's not so much a con as it is a ???.Functionality Pros- There are 13 fully customizeable buttons, 16 if you include the right, left, and middle mouse button. I think for the average user, this should be more than enough, but more details are below in the cons- You can create macros in their program (same as G600 program)- You can adjust 5 levels of DPI, which can be adjusted on the fly using the arrow buttons on the mouse right underneath the scroll wheel. You can also adjust the mouse sensitivity, scrolling speed, an double-click speed in their programFunctionality Cons- As I mentioned before, the average user should have no problem utilizing 13 extra buttons on a mouse - most do not need any more. I personally like having more and have used them in MMO's like World of Warcraft. The G600 offers a \"g-shift\" button, which is a \"click and hold\" feature to the right of its right mouse button that, when held down, changes the whole key settings/bindings, thus allowing buttons 1-12 (+7 of its own) buttons to be bound to other commands. As I mentioned, this probably isn't a big deal to the average MMO user.- A functionality issue that I particularly dislike though is that the DPI buttons cannot be assigned to something else. On my G600, I have those assigned and use them often as I don't need to change my DPI for anything.- The G600 offers a way to tilt the mouse scroll wheel to the left or right with the default command being \"back\" and \"forward\", which I use frequently. The venus does not offer this ability with its scroll wheel, although it can be assigned to one of its 12 side buttons.- The UI of the venus program is not nearly as nice as compared to the Logitech Gaming Software. But to be fair, I believe LGS was supposedly shifted over in favor of some new program called Logitech Hub or something of the sort? I used it once and hated it and went back to LGS.Overall I think for the price and for the average user, it is and can be a great mouse. The comparable mouse on the market would be the G600, which at full price is a little more than 150% the cost of this mouse at full price (G600 $79.99 vs Venus $49.99), however most of the time I've found the G600 to be on sale with my cheapest purchase at around $23 and average at $49. Due to my recent frustrations with the G600 in the microswitches and side button malfunction, I'm wary to recommend that mouse now. But time will tell with the Venus in terms of its quality compared to the G600. I've purchased another G600 for my main desktop since the lack in buttons for my MMO's on the Venus just won't cut it and I've relegated the Venus for my laptop use."}

The buttons are just the right size to click with your thumb and the pressure needed to press them make them easy enough to press in tense moments while also making mistakes fairly rare. I use the back of my thumb to press the last column and this even works pretty well. The rapid fire button feels quite nice to press as well. The scroll wheel is segmented but also smooth.Minor complaints include the fact that I am not a huge fan of the sandpaper feel on the left/right buttons and on the edge. In particular, I found that my ring/pinky fingers started to feel chafed by it when first using it, though I believe use of the device quickly wore it in and I no longer get this feeling. I do also wish the thumb rest was extended a bit further out from the mouse. I do not use it that often, but it is not really wide enough to fit the entire thumb without it hanging off the edge.I love that the mouse is wireless, as I could never get used to the cord snag that occurs with wired models, though it can also be used with a wire if that is your preference. The battery life is superb. I can forget to charge it for days at a time and it will still have juice. The sleep mode activates pretty quickly after not using the mouse for a period of time and will automatically awaken after any movement/button presses and will register said input.The two DPI buttons are placed in a nice spot and there are four red lights, or the absence of light, which indicate five different profiles. These are set to 1000/2000/4000/8000/16000 by default, but you can set them to whatever your preference is. As I find any lights on my mouse/keyboard distracting, I set my preferred DPI on the lowest profile. That said, the RGB lights on the mouse are great. The thumb buttons look particularly cool when it is shining through them. If you want to show off a cool new mouse, this is the one for you.The program for this mouse is also pretty great and easy to understand. The default profile for the thumb buttons sets them to 1-0 on the number row and -/+ on the number pad. I'm not sure why they decided to use the numpad rather than the number row for the last two, as I have played games which contain item slots on the latter number row keys, though they are easily remappable in the program or in-game. The program allows for importing/exporting profiles, which is necessary if using more than two. The profile switch button on the bottom can cycle between the default, which is itself remappable, and an imported profile. The program also allows the user to design macros which is very convenient for the sake of productivity.For gaming, the number row mapping already makes perfect sense for many games. Even though I do not really play MMO games, I found that being able to swap weapons in GTA and items/shouts in Skyrim with the touch of a button was quite an improvement over using the number row, which takes fingers that could be pressing other keys and has an inconveniently placed second half for the left hand to reach. Of course, you can feel free to map it to whichever buttons you want.I also personally use this for video editing and general productivity shortcuts on my PC and I can report that it is excellent for both. My left hand has to move around far less than what it used to, and overall things feel more balanced. Overall extremely pleased with my decision to purchase this mouse and recommend it to anyone who wants a versatile instrument for any of a multitude of computing needs.EDIT: I have dropped this review to four stars because of an issue with the scroll wheel. After having the mouse on for some time the scroll wheel takes two notches to start scrolling in the opposite direction (for instance, if I am scrolling down and I try to scroll up the first notch on the wheel that is scrolled up will do nothing). If I turn the mouse off and then on again it will return to normal, but will, in time, begin to act up again. It is rather minor, but is quite annoying. And I can see this being a detriment in games. I have reached out to Utech's support and have not gotten a response. I am trying again. If my issue is resolved I will return the review to five stars.EDIT: I managed to get in contact with them through the email for the gift inside the box. They were very nice and sent me a new one. While the second one was on the way, my original somehow started working again. I can only surmise that it has something to do with being kept on for a long enough period of time, rather than being turned off and on again after acting up. Anyhow, I am pleased that it has started working again and that I now have a backup in case it messes up once more, and am now raising it back to five stars!"}

I use a kind of a broad claw grip and prefer it when the butt of the mouse rests in the palm of my hand, which this does comfortably while still leaving my fingers well positioned on the buttons. It's also remarkably comfortable, almost as if it was designed with my hand specifically in mind. Obviously your mileage may vary on this one but the at rest position for the third (ring) finger on my hand is well placed, with just the right bit of additional contour to aid in gripping the mouse when lifting it. In addition the descending curve of the side allows my pinky finger to rest against the mouse, partially touching, instead of awkwardly dangling in space as with so many mice, while at the same time allowing me to feel a bit of the pad below so I can judge distance precisely. I cannot over-emphasize how pleasant this is to hold an d use.The action on the scroll wheel is not too stiff nor so soft that I fear accidentally scrolling. The wheel is a straight two axis forward/backward with a distinct rest at each stop (no free spinning here) which is just as I like it. Since there's no tilt wheel there's no risk of accidental presses from the first and second fingers at rest or while scrolling, but the wide position of the buttons is such that this frame could accommodate a four axis scroll wheel without trouble. The action on button1 and button2 is unremarkable and adequate, quite average and nothing worth mentioning. There is an additional button to the left of button1 which is well positioned and is not at risk of accidental pressing, is easily found by touch, and easy to click at will. The DPI control buttons in the top center are raised and sufficiently stiff that there is essentially zero chance of accidental adjustment even during furious use. There are four DPI settings and LEDs clearly indicate which is chosen at any given moment.On the thumb side is a 12 button num bearing the digits 0-9 which act as num keys as well as \"minus\" on 11 and \"plus\" on 12. I had thought that having so many buttons on the side where the thumb rests would either make accidentally depressing them hard or deliberately pressing them hard, and in any case detract from the ability to grip, move, and lift the mouse but this turns out not to be the case. My thumb can rest such that I can with grip the forward edge of the button enclosure--and do so as firmly as I like--without any accidental clicks.  Rocking the thumb back and working by feel makes it fairly easy to click most--but not all--of the keys. I find 1-3 and  7-9 to be easy, 10-12 to be awkward, and 4-6 to be somewhat difficult without accidentally also depressing buttons on adjacent rows. This is far better than I anticipated and leaves me with a gratifyingly large number of buttons available at a twitch.I am a bit disappointed not to find a more usual thumb button on the side forward from the num pad buttons. It seems that there is sufficient space for one and such a button would fit nicely with my grip style, where the num pad position does not. It's not an insurmountable problem to move my thumb back for clicks but forward would be far more compatible with my grip. I suspect the designers anticipate a grip where the thumb rests naturally in the middle of the num pad with the pad of the thumb on the \"5\" key; indeed, in this position clicking all of the buttons does become easier. Still, I am not about to adapt my style to fit a mouse!There are adjustable weights but honestly the difference between empty and filled is not very much. I prefer it with all weights added (because I like my mice heavy) but I fear that if you prefer a feather-weight mouse even with all removed you will not be satisfied.A toggle button on the bottom cycles through five different LED colors. I understand that each color also corresponds to a (configurable) macro set, and certainly each remembers it DPI setting independently. Unfortunately the control software for this mouse is not compatible with Linux and I have not found a working way to alter the mouse behavior on Linux. This is, for me, a deal breaker, because I can't control which key codes are emitted when I use the thumb buttons--and since they correspond by default to keyboard keys I in effect have only three extra buttons on this mouse despite the 16 it has by appearance. The right click button is button2, and the mouse wheel button3, both as usual, but the left click button and the extra button next it are both button1. Since all of the thumb buttons emit by default not \"button\" events but regular key events I am obliged to either redo my RPG keybinding layout to accommodate that or suffer redundancy. I could remap the thumb buttons in to hard-to-each keyboard keys that I don't use for anything now, but this is tedious and irritating.  Still, this is not an issue on a platform supported by the manufacturer so I'm only knocking off one star from the review rather than the 3 that this problem really deserves. For most people this will not at all be an issue.Because of the above problem I did not review the macro capability of them mouse, which is purportedly one of its main selling points. Even without that feature there is a lot to like here: inexpensive, nice and large, comfortable grip, nice action, good weight and feel. For non-gaming and light gaming use I have no problem using this mouse, but for serious gaming where more buttons means more power I can't personally consider it.If I figure out a convenient way to control macros from Linux, or if I find a good way even to remap the key events in to button events, I will report back here and raise the rating."}

First time I've had a wireless mouse with the buttons on the side AND LED lights on it, so I'm decently surprised at how often I can go between charges. I'm not sure if I'm quite getting 70 hours of time out of it, as I can't tell how charged it is or if it is fully charged as the LED that comes on when you plug it in, does not turn off until unplugged. The mouse wheel is a little \"chunky\" feeling? If that makes sense? It kinda feels like whatever turns under the scroll wheel is rusted or might have something on it. Though this could be damage from the driver who unfortunately decided to chuck it over my fence, instead of placing it on my porch, so I can excuse this fault.The only issue I really have with this mouse, is that the software is a little confusing to understand. It looks A LOT like the Red Dragon brand of mouse i've used before, but, since this mouse can program the buttons on the side to do more than one input at a time (you could have 1 button do ctrl+alt+delete) it says Key Combinations instead of \"change Key input\" or something along those lines which threw me off the first time, especially because it didnt come with a manual lol.TL;DR/Overall, I would say this a reliable mouse and is a pretty good budget mouse for things like World of Warcraft (what I use it for)"}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Aimee", "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\nUnmappable DPI buttons and no multi-button support...an average mouse at best", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020", "purchased": "Color: classic black", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Edited, Jan. 8, 2021:I wanted to write this revised review sooner but of course, Amazon has to approve all reviews and then I forgot until now. Anyways, I've dropped the review down to three stars because this mouse is just \"average.\" You can't hold down the button next to the LMB and press another button on the side, i.e. binding top button to Ctrl and pressing a side button to double the amount of button presses.As previously mentioned, you cannot remap the DPI buttons whatsoever.The wired mouse's software is much more in-depth and lets you do all of these things, from what I've researched.After using this mouse for several weeks, the side buttons are no longer consistent in feel and sound. Some buttons are still tactile, while others are almost silent and mushy. The right click feels much softer than the left click, to the point where I almost don't realize I've pushed it. The only saving grace for this mouse at this point is the fact that it's wireless. I won't be returning the mouse as it's not worth the hassle, but I'm definitely going to just stick with a Logitech G600. For the price of the wire, I can enjoy double the button presses with everything being customizable. And it's cheaper a majority of the time.The pouch it includes is nice, and I'll definitely use that. The mouse is not a bad mouse, it's just not exactly what I need for my playstyle. Like I said, it's just average. I knew getting into this that I couldn't remap the DPI buttons, but when I found out about the lack of multi-button support and the wired mouse's counterpart having much more in-depth software...I was very disappointed. I really feel like the issues I've come across are software related, but I don't foresee a software update coming anytime soon for these mice.*****Original Review Below*****Please UtechSmart, let us remap the two buttons under the scroll wheel! I personally never change my DPI once I set it via software, but having the option to use the buttons for something more functional would be nice! Pleeeeease. I know there are several other reviews mentioning this. Those two perfectly good buttons are unused otherwise. Created macros also do not show up in the macro list when attempting to assign them to a key. Because of these two easily fixable software issues that have STILL not been updated, I've docked a star.As for the actual mouse, it's great! First impressions, I was definitely pleased to see a carrying pouch and a detachable braided USB-C cable. I bought this mouse as a substitute for my G600 while I travel, as there is no wireless version of the G600 yet. The driver software is included via a very snazzy looking business card that flips out into a baby USB drive. It does the win+r command and types in a command to open a Dropbox with the software files.The buttons themselves are alright, they'll definitely do the job. The scroll wheel is good, though I wish it tilted like my G600 too. But as that's a hardware thing, I can accept that tradeoff for wireless connectivity. Clicks are not offensively loud like some mice, which I'm definitely grateful for as I'll be using this while traveling. However, the side buttons are a bit audible, much louder than the G600, but still not terrible. (If you have a Nintendo Switch, the side buttons sound similar to pressing the face buttons on the joycons.) The finish on the mouse is...different than I'm used to. But it's not bad, just a bit textured. It's not smooth like a G600 or a Naga, but more like a soft sandpaper, if you will. The entire mouse feels like that except for the shiny section in the middle where your palm rests, and the side buttons. There's a spot under the mouse to store the tiny USB dongle, and it's magnetic rather than snapping in. A very nice touch as I have short fingernails and trying to pry something like that out would be a nightmare.I also enjoy the resting spot for your ring finger, and although it's not a button like my G600, it's still second nature for me to have a finger there. The third clicking button I use on my G600 was just moved to the left of the left mouse button, which I am perfectly fine with. It's not a bad placement and I can easily reach it plus all twelve of the side buttons, effectively doubling the button inputs.Getting onto the software, it's...usable. When I first installed it, I could not for the life of me get the colors on the mouse to change. And as I was searching for the solution, suddenly about 15 or so minutes later, the lights just started cooperating. Very odd. It works flawlessly now so I have no complaints, just confusion.The software lets you choose what buttons you want to use, but you have to choose the option \"Key Combination\" and just press the key without any modifiers in order to do so. Just in case anyone has any confusion like I did at first.The lighting is all one color, no per-key RGB here. Which is fine, my G600 is the same. I do enjoy the amount of lights though! The scroll wheel illumination is very nice, and the logo illumination is bright. However, the lights on the front of the mouse seem to be different colors between the three grills on either side, which isn't a big deal to me personally.Mapping keys (once I figured it out) was quick, changing the DPI setting via software and disabling the other DPI profiles (hence, making those buttons useless) was painless.I'm grateful the software allows macros, but I couldn't get them to show up in the macro list when I tried to assign them to a key, which, like the DPI buttons, makes them useless.TL;DRPros:The mouse comes with a nice pouch and braided USB-C cable.Feels good to use, a decent wireless substitute to the G600.Mapping keys was quick and painless.Lights are bright and seem to be fairly accurate. (Note: You cannot change the four lights next to the DPI buttons, so I turn mine off.)Mouse weighs similar to a G600.Cons:THE SOFTWARE. Seriously. Please, let me remap the DPI buttons just like the side buttons (which the wired version allows) and let me have the ability to use my macros. If I knew coding and could fix it myself, I absolutely would.Literally the only things wrong with this mouse are software related. I don't understand why these issues haven't been fixed. If you can have a fancy business card that runs an entire string of code to download software, why can't said software be fixed?"}

Sines III", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nnice", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021", "purchased": "Color: classic black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I own two of the previous wired model of this mouse (work & home).  I love it.  My wife bough the wireless version recently and loved it as well.  I then bought the wireless version for work so I wouldn't have to have my \"go to meetings mouse\" in addition to my main wired mouse.  The pricing (on both versions) is also very reasonable.There are good & bad between the models.  There are aspects to the new software that I like and some that I dislike.  The wired version was hampered by having to use older software to get all the functionality.  This one can use the new software.Lighting:There are additional lighting effects that were not available on the wired version.  These features are still lacking in variety and options, but that is a minor complaint.  Specifically, while plugged in it pulses a color (based on battery charge) rather than the light setting chosen.  I'd love to just use it wired when at my desk and wireless when off to meetings and such.  I love the light color cycling and miss that when it is plugged in.Weight Compartment:The wired version had the bottom compartment with additional weights.  This version is lacking that and thus a bit lighter than I am used to.  While I liked the heavier weight it isn't a deal breaker for me.Software:The software, while newer, has fewer options for programming the keys compared to the older version.  The older version had a ton of pre-made keys that were easy and available.  You can get to the same functionality, but you have to add them as key combinations.  An example was the old software had a pre-done entry for copy, paste, and other basic functions.  On this one I had to manually create a \"ctrl + c\" hotkey.  Again, not a huge issue for me, but I could see it being less useful for others who may not have an idea of what to put on all the keys.  It certainly felt like a step backwards on that aspect.  I suspect this has to do with them storing the profile on the mouse directly rather than in a file.Profiles:The software not having the profiles or way to toggle between them was odd.  There is no indicator for which profile you are on.  The button on the bottom to toggle profiles just felt odd as well.  This might be worth the trade-off for having the two profiles on the mouse though.  I absolutely hated that I couldn't convert my current profile onto the new mouse (.pdf profile in older version vs .jmk in this one).  This forced me to re-create all my macros and re-assign them.  Again, not a deal breaker as it is a one time setup and only impacts people with prior versions.  Note, the software is PC only.  You can set the mouse up on a Windows machine, it stores the profiles on the mouse, then you can use the mouse without issue on a Mac.Misc:The slot for the dongle on the bottom of the mouse is a bit odd.  It sticks out just far enough that you can't use the mouse with the wired charger while the dongle is put in the mouse for storage.  I don't understand why they didn't do the recessed tabs on top/bottom of it so you could grip it to pull the dongle out (like most other dongle storage layouts are).  I suspect it is mostly a non-issue since you don't remove the dongle while you have it plugged in, it just seemed like an odd design choice (maybe something they can fix in the next hardware revision/version).The Good:Good size that fits hand very comfortably with the nice textured finishGood quantity of buttons to programHigh precision with adjustable DPI to get mouse movements just rightMultiple profiles for different tasksBetter lighting options compared to prior versionsprofiles stored on mouse (limit 2)The Less Good:no additional weight compartment in wireless version (wired version has it)lighting options, while better, are still underwhelminglighting option when plugged in is not existentless pre-created macro/key options in software compared to earlier versions (can manually create for functionality, just lose the ease of it)The Badnothing that would sway my purchase decisionSummary:This is a great mouse for the price.  It is very comfortable to use and ticks off all the quality items needed for a functional mouse for gaming or customization of buttons.  The software is its greatest weakness, but not detrimental to the point where it has a functional impact (just the area they should focus more effort on).  I back this up with this wireless mouse version being my third of this style/brand of mouse for my own use (2 wired, 1 wireless) plus my wife's use of both the wired and wireless version too.Mac users need to be aware of the software limitation so they can get it setup on a Windows machine first, then they'll be ready to go."}

The DPI buttons can NOT be reprogrammed (on the wireless version).", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2017", "purchased": "Color: Black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I really liked the wired version of this mouse and it lasted over 3 and a half years of hard intense use before the left clicker finally started acting up and for some reasons I couldn't get macros to work anymore. So I decided to buy the wireless version. I tried to review it separately but the review button just brings me up to edit the wired version's review I wrote ages ago... So with that confusion cleared up, let's talk about this new tail-less mouse in my house!FREEDOOOOOM!!!!!After a few days of use I gotta say I LOVE IT! No more wire in the way, or always causing drag on the mouse. I can aim better in games and the freedom from wires is a big deal to me. With the leds disabled the battery drops less then 20% even after gaming like 12 hours and recharges very fast when I need to. I can't notice any lag or delay at all vs a wired mouse (all actions and movement are instant), so all those fears of a latency filled experience can be put to rest.This venus mouse is a seriously good deal at the $40 bucks I got it at, considering the naga pro is $150. You'd think you are getting some cheap plastic junk, but you would be very wrong. This is a very good mouse just like the wired version is. And like the wired version not only is it great for gaming, but for productivity I like it even more. Having the numpad is amazing for doing work and I think the name of the mouse should be renamed. It is MORE THEN JUST A MMO MOUSE!The only real negatives I can think of are-No wheel side buttons.Some folks might want even more buttons (like wheel left\\right).Having the LED lights on will drain battery much faster (true for any wireless device).Macro functions are not as robust as razor's synapse program.But to me the most major negative is worth of it's own large title to emphasize this problem-NO YOU CAN NOT REPROGRAM THE DPI BUTTONS!Unfortunately despite it saying you can in the instructions\\box\\online product information, you actually can not. And no there isn't a more recent update that fixes this as of feb 2021. I have held off for YEARS buying this mouse because I noticed reviews saying you can't reprogram them, but a dying mouse forced my hand. I had hoped they updated the software by now, sadly they haven't.It isn't unique to this mouse either, the red dragon wireless mmo mouse has the exact same shortcoming. I think you CAN on the razor naga pro, but it costs 3 times as much and a number of people report serious clicking issues with it which kinda scared me off especially considering the high price. I also hate that razor synapse runs all the time and requires internet, and I also hate snakes which is the entire theme of their mice for some reason. I ain't want no got dang snakes on my plane!Soo why in the world does the venus mmo mouse product information say you can reprogram the dpi buttons? Translation issues maybe? Dunno, I just know that this is not only misleading but also disappointing. And Why does this matter to me enough to drone on about it?well...I loved using those buttons as my page up and page down on the wired version of this same mouse, a real time saver for browsing pages, or working through various text\\adobe documents, or even scrolling up and down in video game chat boxes to see messages I missed. I will truly miss those handy buttons. I tried to find a 3rd party app that lets me do this, but I can't find any. The ones out there only let you change basic buttons like right, left, middle click.So I am stuck with useless DPI buttons... seriously who uses those for dpi changing on the fly? I never find a need for that in any game or task. I think vastly more people would use these as page up and down, seems like the PERFECT use for them *shrugs*.It's not easy to accidentally bump these 2 buttons but it will happen now n then which is a little annoying when your mouse is suddenly too sensitive and flying all over the screen. Not a deal breaker, just something to keep in mind.Overall it's a good wireless mouse and is ridiculously cheap. There is not enough of these numpad wireless mouse out there, and that's a shame because I don't see why you'd want anything else. I've been using numpad mice for almost a decade now and I can't go back to regular mice now. You will likely find through the years ever more uses for them, which means its a growing convenience that ages very well. Today you buy one thinking it's JUST FOR MMO's but in 5 years you will find yourself using the numpad for soo much more and wondering how you ever lived with a normal mouse. I have no doubts that wireless mice are the future, I just hope the numpad mice don't all disappear in time as mmo's become a thing of the past (warcraft is sooo lame now).4 stars.I am docking a star because of the DPI button lie\\miscommunication. That is really unfortunate because otherwise it's such a solid product. I will gladly add that star if Utech gives us an update that actually lets us reprogram those buttons, but I'd say this is unlikely given how old this model is already. Their coders are likely onto new projects.NAGA PRO-well... maybe some snakes aren't bad?I do suspect that if you get a healthy naga pro that doesn't have the clicking issues people report about, it very likely would be the better wireless numpad mouse, It just costs 3 times as much and synapse wants to always be online which is annoying. If you need robust macro options or even more buttons and you can afford it, it might be your only real option, there isn't enough models of these wireless numpad mice out there so our options are quite limited."}

Thumb rest is a thumb saver too, wish other name brand numpad mice had them, I would consider them then.Updated 2018: After 3 years of use the side 6 button stopped working completely, and then the scroll click broke, doesn't even depress and make a sound, and I finally had to replace the mouse. Scroll click would work intermittently for about a year, sometimes just re-plugging fixed it, sometimes a reboot would not, but it would start working again few days later.Update 2021: 3 more years and no buttons have worn out or died, but the texture has started wearing under my fingers. Now the palm rest feels more textured than the front, the left click has a spot the size of a pin head worn down to the plastic, with the right click probably a year away from doing the same. Planning on having my new job pay for one though, becasue I'd rather get something I know than an ergonomic mouse that may not feel right, and those are more expensive and usually wireless (I don't want to deal with batteries or the inevitable \"why won't my mouse connect?\")Update 2022: made it almost 4 years this time, left click has started \"double clicking\". Trying to do a hold click like drag-and-drop, or holding a click in a game it does an initial click, releases, then holds the click. Annoying, but worth $30 for another.The newer versions of this no longer have the smoother rubber-like coating and are now noticeably textured, likely because of complaints about the coating scratching or becoming slippery with use. It never scratched for me and it didn't get slippery even after gaming all day, but maybe mine happened to be a good one. It's only noticeable when you move your fingers across he surface and only feels slightly different during normal use.Update 2021: 3 more years and no buttons have worn out or died, but the texture has started wearing under my fingers. Now the palm rest feels more textured than the front, the left click has a spot the size of a pin head worn down to the plastic, with the right click probably a year away from doing the same. Planning on having my new job pay for one though, becasue I'd rather get something I know than an ergonomic mouse that may not feel right, and those are more expensive and usually wireless (I don't want to deal with batteries or the inevitable \"why won't my mouse connect?\")Initial Review: For two years of college I unplugged this, coiled it up, and put it in my backpack to use with my laptop. Every. Day. The plug never felt loose after so much plugging and unplugging, the cord has no kinks or frays, and never had any issues with the mouse disconnecting, so the cord is VERY durable. In fact, I hit the plug while it was in my laptop once and it broke the port: the plug didn't bend at all.The mouse buttons have a short travel, don't require a firm click, are a bit quieter than than the cheap $10 mouse I used to have, and have a more pleasant click tone than a normal mouse. The side buttons are very useful and are mechanical switches that require a bit more pressure than the left/right click but are very responsive: they do not travel until you apply enough pressure and then the response is instant. They have a more muted and lower pitched click sound. .The rows of buttons are angled in opposite directions to make them identifiable, however the back two rows are more awkward to use if you rest your hand to easily reach the front row becasue of how you have to bend your thumb. The 5 and 8 buttons have bumps that are supposed to distinguish them, but they're hard to notice unless you rub the tip of your thumb back and forth.The double-click button I've found very useful in several games, though it requires a slight grip alteration to reach it. It's also mechanical, requires barely more pressure to press than the left/right buttons, and makes a bit lower pitched click that's also a bit less pleasant sounding but is not louder.The thumb-rest is great and I would not go back to a mouse without one now, which brings me to a minor complaint of not much of a pinkie rest, as this mouse seems ergonomically designed for your middle finger to rest on the scroll wheel instead of the right mouse button, so my pinkie rests on the side, but does not drag on my desk (though I have below-average sized hands hands) and is still more comfortable than a normal mouse.The driver software is very functional and does everything it needs to well, with no useless gimmicks or half-functional features. The LED's color and brightness are fully adjustable (three brightness options, but can make it dimmer using the custom color selector). The new driver version released this year (V 1.2) supposedly now allows changing the scroll wheel LED color, but only for the newer mouse version, which I keep forgetting to test. All buttons can be customized and can have macros assigned (my brother set his double-click button to the profile switch. I got him one too). From experience, it's best to add probably 5-10ms delay between key inputs in a macro, or weird stuff can happen. In one game as soon as i used a macro of a click and key without delay I was unable to click on anything in the game, even menus, and had to force-close it.The really nice part is the profiles are saved to memory in the mouse, so it will be fully functional - DPI settings, macros, and all - on a computer without the drivers. Just be warned that installing the drivers on a new computer will not load the profiles from the mouse and will override the profiles saved on the mouse, so if you plan on putting the driver on more than one PC export the profile to a file with the driver software to copy over."}

I'm always looking for the best of the best to get a better experience for comfort in playing competitive games, editing photos, editing videos, music production, ect.(Gaming mouse 1) My first gaming mouse that i bought was a \"Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB\", lasted me for a 1 year but the thing i didn't like was the difficulty in software, the dull looking colors, and most important to me the \"wire\" on the mouse that i didn't like & not able to take it off and on. It broke and the threading was coming off and the mouse rubber became this weird sticky feel and note that i'm a clean freak but that's the long term effect of those mouse's. Lost -$80.00(Gaming mouse 2) My next gaming mouse i got was a \"Razor Naga mouse\". I felt it was to bulky, unnatural feeling, and it was a HUGE pain. The sensor broke where it would randomly stop responding to movement even when wired or wireless and i scraped that one. Spent at the time about $65-$100 for it. Now -$65-$100 gone.(Mouse 3) So i was using a simple 2 button wireless mouse for years to come after bad experience with the others, than i when back into the search for that vision mouse in my head. I love the Corsair Side buttons & changing color concept, I somewhat liked the razor battery, I loved my 2 button wireless \"feel/shape\" & \"freedom to wireless\" to my hand.(Search Story) I could not find nothing and the things that i somewhat liked where all wired to the mouse after looking at many youtube videos, searching google, ect. Until i found out about \"UtechSmart Venus Pro RGB Wireless MMO\" & there it said \"49.99\" on amazon. I was like there is no way this exists, instantly love what specs they have, the RGB, the side buttons to how its made was very unique, Wireless ECT so i ended up buying it. It came, and in a instance i open the box. My first reaction was 10/10. It came with a protection pouch, usb, to instantly download \"latest software\" which i completely did not expect, along with a ton of features i didn't expect.(UtechSmart Venus Pro RGB Wireless MMO thoughts/reaction) One thing I instantly loved was the grippy feel to it, I absolutely love this mouse and lowkey for the 2 weeks kept going in my backpack just to feel it because it was weirdly satisfying lol. One thing i notice is they had the best accurate/bright customizable RGB light which is both great for lit room & dark room set ups for that nice aesthetic look. Pressing the buttons feels amazing, I notice for the side buttons design is different with a dip wavy style which at first I thought was weird because I never seen/experienced anything like it \"BUT\" it completely gave me \"way more control\" when gaming i notice I'm not making any \"miss click mistakes\" including in \"World of Warcraft\" & with the corsair/naga i notice i always made to many miss click mistakes because the buttons just felt all the same to me also  on those mouse i only used the half of middle/top because of that big issue. Under the mouse side button there is a \"Thumb\" support & man i can't tell you enough how important that is when gaming, that actually stopped giving me thumb pain & setting my thumb position to more accurate response times. Yo they even have a \"Step\" DPI dial button switch with led indicators on steps (for how sensitive you like your mouse movement) located under the scrolling wheel on the middle mouse so you don't have to go back into the software and adjust when playing, also you will not accidently press it throwing off your game playing. Most important thing is that the mouse shape/grove of how the mouse feels is perfect when placing your hand on top of it. It's very natural feeling and very comfortable, your hand never gets tired and the ring finger & pinky finger will not cramp/get tired. Now for battery life i don't even remember how often i charge it because i swear i'm only charging this thing once a month with led always on (Im on my computer 8+ hours a day and lets not forget my travel laptop). This is hands down the best mouse & with best price. I tired all the expensive stuff, it all failed me, saying this with respect. This is forever my favorite company and I will stick with this company till the day I die man. Whoever designed & planned this mouse is a an absolute genius and has a ridiculous level of attention to detail."}

I recently got the wireless one as well, and loved it until it stopped working/charging after a month (right outside of the Amazon return window).  The link to the support website through Amazon was not English, so I was struggling to figure out the warranty return, but the seller was great to quickly respond to my Amazon review comment.  They were very apologetic and courteous in offering a replacement.The software for the mouse is easy and intuitive, and I have enjoyed the side buttons a lot.  I use it for MMO (FF14) gaming on PS5 and it works perfectly.  I was a little worried about if the side key customizations would work with the PS5, but they work perfect.  You just plug in the mouse to a PC, customize the side buttons with the included software, and it saves the key combos/macros the the mouse. You can then use the customized buttons wirelessly no problem.Hopefully, it was just bad luck the first time, because it really is otherwise a great product for the price.  The texture, ergonomics, function, and customization are really great for an affordable gaming mouse."}

The configurable sensitivity level rises to the mammoth 16400 DPI. Now that's extraordinary. Playing games like Counter-Strike and League of Legends became a charm once I took the learning curve in stride. The vivid RGB lighting customization is a deserving shout-out, adding the desired aesthetic for late-night gaming sessions.But even Venus had its flaws. Having 12 side buttons brought complexity rather than convenience. Toggling through them during high-paced games could quickly become a strenuous thumb gymnastic. Nevertheless, practicing their use saw an enhancement in performance over time. The 'Auto Fire Button' and easily adjustable weights are delightful editions that make a real difference.Comfort-wise, this mouse fits like a glove. With six years of regular use, it still functioned properly. However, as it's built more for right-handed gamers, Southpaws's gaming populace might need help adapting. Lastly, its price might bog some of the budget players down - but if you look at it as a long-term investment, you'd know it's worth every penny.In absolute terms, the UtechSmart Venus Gaming Mouse has scaled itself respectably in the game. While its comprehensive capabilities might require getting used to it, it offers a bang for the buck deal. For serious gamers, it's not just the finished artifact—it's also about the journey. I'd give it a daring 4.1 out of 5 stars for its fantastic performance garnished with unmissable blemishes."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Minor Henderson", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nIT'S GREAT (IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SACRIFICE SOME THINGS) [read below]", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2020", "purchased": "Color: classic black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗺𝘆 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲:𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱: The wired version started double clicking after 3 years of constant use. Also, there's not a lot of affordable options for a wireless MMO mouse. I liked my experience with the original, so I gave this one a shot.𝗙𝗶𝘁: I have small hands, but I wouldn't choose any other mouse over this. Every finger has a place, so I always feel like I have full control. The negative about this mouse compared to the wired version is that the \"pinky slot\" is more caved in. I thought it would make for a more comfortable fit, but it actually causes pinky fatigue.𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: it performs just like the wired version. There are some differences here though. Due to it having a battery, I'll never be able to make it as light weight as the wired version. The \"70 hour\" claim is a little weird. I feel like this is only achievable if you disable the lights (to use less battery). However, I use this mouse all day, and it will last me two days easily before charging. The third day however, I'm only able to get away with \"light\" use. The \"power saving\" does help with this though. Sometimes I may end up cooking in the kitchen or taking a shower, and I don't have to worry about turning off my mouse.𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: Unfortunately it does have the same issues as the previous version. Some buttons are bright, while others are dim. This also means that sometimes the colors don't match. I also found when changing colors in the software it's not nearly as good the wired version. They're not very accurate to the selection you make within the software. To make it all worse, the mouse wheel will usually be a mismatch to the rest of the mouse when changing colors. (not just a shade or two off either, it's a completely different color.) So you're limited to the certain colors if you want everything to be congruent.𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲: This is where this mouse takes a massive hit. Your options are extremely limited. You can't customize a button to \"profile switch\" or reassign the \"dpi\" buttons to something else. This doesn't affect me, because I always use the dpi buttons as dpi buttons anyway. To add fuel to the fire, YOU ONLY HAVE 2 ACTIVE PROFILES INSTEAD OF 5. I have found a work around for this though. Simply make a profile for your each one of your needs. (different games, software, browsers, etc.) You can make as many as you want. Then export each one to the same folder. Repeat the process until you have all your profiles in one folder. Set your main 2 profiles (the ones you use the most) as the ones in use. Then whenever you want to switch just, open the software, go to \"import profile\" and boom (everything that you need will be waiting for you.) I have pictures, showing what I mean.I do this because I have modes for browsing, gaming, and editing. It's a pain at first, but I really don't mind it now. I think it would have been great if you could've imported profiles from the wired version into the wireless software to speed things up. The macro editor feels eh as well. I was able to screenshot with the wired version, that isn't the case with this. Sometimes I feel like the battery % isn't accurate at all. To top it off, I'm pretty sure they have no intentions on updating the software. Which is disappointing.𝗧𝗟;𝗗𝗥 (𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆)𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀:- Great fit- Great performance- Nearly identical to the wired version- wireless, with no latency issues- great battery (heavy use = 2 days, light use = 4+)- affordable- usb-c𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀:- Software is lacking (and I doubt it will be improved)- DPI buttons are NOT customizable- Can only switch between 2 profiles at a time, instead of 5 with the wired version (I mention a work around for this above)- Forced to use the \"profile switch\" button on the bottom the mouse [YOU CANNOT PROGRAM IT TO A BUTTON LIKE OTHER MICE]- Light (in general, not light as in light shades) colors are not accurate(this goes for the actual color, the buttons have varying brightness levels, and the mouse wheel usually doesn't match the other colors when customizing. It's a completely different color)- Macro editor feels clunky [some macros are only available for the wired version, ex: screenshot (win + ps)]- the new shape of the mouse can cause slight fatigue (this may only be my experience)I gave it a 4 stars instead of 3 because I found workarounds for most of my issues. The software is what's really holding it back from a 4.5 - 5 stars."}

I love it.  My wife bough the wireless version recently and loved it as well.  I then bought the wireless version for work so I wouldn't have to have my \"go to meetings mouse\" in addition to my main wired mouse.  The pricing (on both versions) is also very reasonable.There are good & bad between the models.  There are aspects to the new software that I like and some that I dislike.  The wired version was hampered by having to use older software to get all the functionality.  This one can use the new software.Lighting:There are additional lighting effects that were not available on the wired version.  These features are still lacking in variety and options, but that is a minor complaint.  Specifically, while plugged in it pulses a color (based on battery charge) rather than the light setting chosen.  I'd love to just use it wired when at my desk and wireless when off to meetings and such.  I love the light color cycling and miss that when it is plugged in.Weight Compartment:The wired version had the bottom compartment with additional weights.  This version is lacking that and thus a bit lighter than I am used to.  While I liked the heavier weight it isn't a deal breaker for me.Software:The software, while newer, has fewer options for programming the keys compared to the older version.  The older version had a ton of pre-made keys that were easy and available.  You can get to the same functionality, but you have to add them as key combinations.  An example was the old software had a pre-done entry for copy, paste, and other basic functions.  On this one I had to manually create a \"ctrl + c\" hotkey.  Again, not a huge issue for me, but I could see it being less useful for others who may not have an idea of what to put on all the keys.  It certainly felt like a step backwards on that aspect.  I suspect this has to do with them storing the profile on the mouse directly rather than in a file.Profiles:The software not having the profiles or way to toggle between them was odd.  There is no indicator for which profile you are on.  The button on the bottom to toggle profiles just felt odd as well.  This might be worth the trade-off for having the two profiles on the mouse though.  I absolutely hated that I couldn't convert my current profile onto the new mouse (.pdf profile in older version vs .jmk in this one).  This forced me to re-create all my macros and re-assign them.  Again, not a deal breaker as it is a one time setup and only impacts people with prior versions.  Note, the software is PC only.  You can set the mouse up on a Windows machine, it stores the profiles on the mouse, then you can use the mouse without issue on a Mac.Misc:The slot for the dongle on the bottom of the mouse is a bit odd.  It sticks out just far enough that you can't use the mouse with the wired charger while the dongle is put in the mouse for storage.  I don't understand why they didn't do the recessed tabs on top/bottom of it so you could grip it to pull the dongle out (like most other dongle storage layouts are).  I suspect it is mostly a non-issue since you don't remove the dongle while you have it plugged in, it just seemed like an odd design choice (maybe something they can fix in the next hardware revision/version).The Good:Good size that fits hand very comfortably with the nice textured finishGood quantity of buttons to programHigh precision with adjustable DPI to get mouse movements just rightMultiple profiles for different tasksBetter lighting options compared to prior versionsprofiles stored on mouse (limit 2)The Less Good:no additional weight compartment in wireless version (wired version has it)lighting options, while better, are still underwhelminglighting option when plugged in is not existentless pre-created macro/key options in software compared to earlier versions (can manually create for functionality, just lose the ease of it)The Badnothing that would sway my purchase decisionSummary:This is a great mouse for the price.  It is very comfortable to use and ticks off all the quality items needed for a functional mouse for gaming or customization of buttons.  The software is its greatest weakness, but not detrimental to the point where it has a functional impact (just the area they should focus more effort on).  I back this up with this wireless mouse version being my third of this style/brand of mouse for my own use (2 wired, 1 wireless) plus my wife's use of both the wired and wireless version too.Mac users need to be aware of the software limitation so they can get it setup on a Windows machine first, then they'll be ready to go."}

The DPI buttons can NOT be reprogrammed (on the wireless version).", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2017", "purchased": "Color: Black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I really liked the wired version of this mouse and it lasted over 3 and a half years of hard intense use before the left clicker finally started acting up and for some reasons I couldn't get macros to work anymore. So I decided to buy the wireless version. I tried to review it separately but the review button just brings me up to edit the wired version's review I wrote ages ago... So with that confusion cleared up, let's talk about this new tail-less mouse in my house!FREEDOOOOOM!!!!!After a few days of use I gotta say I LOVE IT! No more wire in the way, or always causing drag on the mouse. I can aim better in games and the freedom from wires is a big deal to me. With the leds disabled the battery drops less then 20% even after gaming like 12 hours and recharges very fast when I need to. I can't notice any lag or delay at all vs a wired mouse (all actions and movement are instant), so all those fears of a latency filled experience can be put to rest.This venus mouse is a seriously good deal at the $40 bucks I got it at, considering the naga pro is $150. You'd think you are getting some cheap plastic junk, but you would be very wrong. This is a very good mouse just like the wired version is. And like the wired version not only is it great for gaming, but for productivity I like it even more. Having the numpad is amazing for doing work and I think the name of the mouse should be renamed. It is MORE THEN JUST A MMO MOUSE!The only real negatives I can think of are-No wheel side buttons.Some folks might want even more buttons (like wheel left\\right).Having the LED lights on will drain battery much faster (true for any wireless device).Macro functions are not as robust as razor's synapse program.But to me the most major negative is worth of it's own large title to emphasize this problem-NO YOU CAN NOT REPROGRAM THE DPI BUTTONS!Unfortunately despite it saying you can in the instructions\\box\\online product information, you actually can not. And no there isn't a more recent update that fixes this as of feb 2021. I have held off for YEARS buying this mouse because I noticed reviews saying you can't reprogram them, but a dying mouse forced my hand. I had hoped they updated the software by now, sadly they haven't.It isn't unique to this mouse either, the red dragon wireless mmo mouse has the exact same shortcoming. I think you CAN on the razor naga pro, but it costs 3 times as much and a number of people report serious clicking issues with it which kinda scared me off especially considering the high price. I also hate that razor synapse runs all the time and requires internet, and I also hate snakes which is the entire theme of their mice for some reason. I ain't want no got dang snakes on my plane!Soo why in the world does the venus mmo mouse product information say you can reprogram the dpi buttons? Translation issues maybe? Dunno, I just know that this is not only misleading but also disappointing. And Why does this matter to me enough to drone on about it?well...I loved using those buttons as my page up and page down on the wired version of this same mouse, a real time saver for browsing pages, or working through various text\\adobe documents, or even scrolling up and down in video game chat boxes to see messages I missed. I will truly miss those handy buttons. I tried to find a 3rd party app that lets me do this, but I can't find any. The ones out there only let you change basic buttons like right, left, middle click.So I am stuck with useless DPI buttons... seriously who uses those for dpi changing on the fly? I never find a need for that in any game or task. I think vastly more people would use these as page up and down, seems like the PERFECT use for them *shrugs*.It's not easy to accidentally bump these 2 buttons but it will happen now n then which is a little annoying when your mouse is suddenly too sensitive and flying all over the screen. Not a deal breaker, just something to keep in mind.Overall it's a good wireless mouse and is ridiculously cheap. There is not enough of these numpad wireless mouse out there, and that's a shame because I don't see why you'd want anything else. I've been using numpad mice for almost a decade now and I can't go back to regular mice now. You will likely find through the years ever more uses for them, which means its a growing convenience that ages very well. Today you buy one thinking it's JUST FOR MMO's but in 5 years you will find yourself using the numpad for soo much more and wondering how you ever lived with a normal mouse. I have no doubts that wireless mice are the future, I just hope the numpad mice don't all disappear in time as mmo's become a thing of the past (warcraft is sooo lame now).4 stars.I am docking a star because of the DPI button lie\\miscommunication. That is really unfortunate because otherwise it's such a solid product. I will gladly add that star if Utech gives us an update that actually lets us reprogram those buttons, but I'd say this is unlikely given how old this model is already. Their coders are likely onto new projects.NAGA PRO-well... maybe some snakes aren't bad?I do suspect that if you get a healthy naga pro that doesn't have the clicking issues people report about, it very likely would be the better wireless numpad mouse, It just costs 3 times as much and synapse wants to always be online which is annoying. If you need robust macro options or even more buttons and you can afford it, it might be your only real option, there isn't enough models of these wireless numpad mice out there so our options are quite limited."}

Annoying, but worth $30 for another.The newer versions of this no longer have the smoother rubber-like coating and are now noticeably textured, likely because of complaints about the coating scratching or becoming slippery with use. It never scratched for me and it didn't get slippery even after gaming all day, but maybe mine happened to be a good one.

Planning on having my new job pay for one though, becasue I'd rather get something I know than an ergonomic mouse that may not feel right, and those are more expensive and usually wireless (I don't want to deal with batteries or the inevitable \"why won't my mouse connect?\")Initial Review: For two years of college I unplugged this, coiled it up, and put it in my backpack to use with my laptop. Every. Day. The plug never felt loose after so much plugging and unplugging, the cord has no kinks or frays, and never had any issues with the mouse disconnecting, so the cord is VERY durable. In fact, I hit the plug while it was in my laptop once and it broke the port: the plug didn't bend at all.The mouse buttons have a short travel, don't require a firm click, are a bit quieter than than the cheap $10 mouse I used to have, and have a more pleasant click tone than a normal mouse. The side buttons are very useful and are mechanical switches that require a bit more pressure than the left/right click but are very responsive: they do not travel until you apply enough pressure and then the response is instant. They have a more muted and lower pitched click sound. .The rows of buttons are angled in opposite directions to make them identifiable, however the back two rows are more awkward to use if you rest your hand to easily reach the front row becasue of how you have to bend your thumb. The 5 and 8 buttons have bumps that are supposed to distinguish them, but they're hard to notice unless you rub the tip of your thumb back and forth.The double-click button I've found very useful in several games, though it requires a slight grip alteration to reach it. It's also mechanical, requires barely more pressure to press than the left/right buttons, and makes a bit lower pitched click that's also a bit less pleasant sounding but is not louder.The thumb-rest is great and I would not go back to a mouse without one now, which brings me to a minor complaint of not much of a pinkie rest, as this mouse seems ergonomically designed for your middle finger to rest on the scroll wheel instead of the right mouse button, so my pinkie rests on the side, but does not drag on my desk (though I have below-average sized hands hands) and is still more comfortable than a normal mouse.The driver software is very functional and does everything it needs to well, with no useless gimmicks or half-functional features. The LED's color and brightness are fully adjustable (three brightness options, but can make it dimmer using the custom color selector). The new driver version released this year (V 1.2) supposedly now allows changing the scroll wheel LED color, but only for the newer mouse version, which I keep forgetting to test. All buttons can be customized and can have macros assigned (my brother set his double-click button to the profile switch. I got him one too). From experience, it's best to add probably 5-10ms delay between key inputs in a macro, or weird stuff can happen. In one game as soon as i used a macro of a click and key without delay I was unable to click on anything in the game, even menus, and had to force-close it.The really nice part is the profiles are saved to memory in the mouse, so it will be fully functional - DPI settings, macros, and all - on a computer without the drivers. Just be warned that installing the drivers on a new computer will not load the profiles from the mouse and will override the profiles saved on the mouse, so if you plan on putting the driver on more than one PC export the profile to a file with the driver software to copy over."}

I'm always looking for the best of the best to get a better experience for comfort in playing competitive games, editing photos, editing videos, music production, ect.(Gaming mouse 1) My first gaming mouse that i bought was a \"Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB\", lasted me for a 1 year but the thing i didn't like was the difficulty in software, the dull looking colors, and most important to me the \"wire\" on the mouse that i didn't like & not able to take it off and on. It broke and the threading was coming off and the mouse rubber became this weird sticky feel and note that i'm a clean freak but that's the long term effect of those mouse's. Lost -$80.00(Gaming mouse 2) My next gaming mouse i got was a \"Razor Naga mouse\". I felt it was to bulky, unnatural feeling, and it was a HUGE pain. The sensor broke where it would randomly stop responding to movement even when wired or wireless and i scraped that one. Spent at the time about $65-$100 for it. Now -$65-$100 gone.(Mouse 3) So i was using a simple 2 button wireless mouse for years to come after bad experience with the others, than i when back into the search for that vision mouse in my head. I love the Corsair Side buttons & changing color concept, I somewhat liked the razor battery, I loved my 2 button wireless \"feel/shape\" & \"freedom to wireless\" to my hand.(Search Story) I could not find nothing and the things that i somewhat liked where all wired to the mouse after looking at many youtube videos, searching google, ect. Until i found out about \"UtechSmart Venus Pro RGB Wireless MMO\" & there it said \"49.99\" on amazon. I was like there is no way this exists, instantly love what specs they have, the RGB, the side buttons to how its made was very unique, Wireless ECT so i ended up buying it. It came, and in a instance i open the box. My first reaction was 10/10. It came with a protection pouch, usb, to instantly download \"latest software\" which i completely did not expect, along with a ton of features i didn't expect.(UtechSmart Venus Pro RGB Wireless MMO thoughts/reaction) One thing I instantly loved was the grippy feel to it, I absolutely love this mouse and lowkey for the 2 weeks kept going in my backpack just to feel it because it was weirdly satisfying lol. One thing i notice is they had the best accurate/bright customizable RGB light which is both great for lit room & dark room set ups for that nice aesthetic look. Pressing the buttons feels amazing, I notice for the side buttons design is different with a dip wavy style which at first I thought was weird because I never seen/experienced anything like it \"BUT\" it completely gave me \"way more control\" when gaming i notice I'm not making any \"miss click mistakes\" including in \"World of Warcraft\" & with the corsair/naga i notice i always made to many miss click mistakes because the buttons just felt all the same to me also  on those mouse i only used the half of middle/top because of that big issue. Under the mouse side button there is a \"Thumb\" support & man i can't tell you enough how important that is when gaming, that actually stopped giving me thumb pain & setting my thumb position to more accurate response times. Yo they even have a \"Step\" DPI dial button switch with led indicators on steps (for how sensitive you like your mouse movement) located under the scrolling wheel on the middle mouse so you don't have to go back into the software and adjust when playing, also you will not accidently press it throwing off your game playing. Most important thing is that the mouse shape/grove of how the mouse feels is perfect when placing your hand on top of it. It's very natural feeling and very comfortable, your hand never gets tired and the ring finger & pinky finger will not cramp/get tired. Now for battery life i don't even remember how often i charge it because i swear i'm only charging this thing once a month with led always on (Im on my computer 8+ hours a day and lets not forget my travel laptop). This is hands down the best mouse & with best price. I tired all the expensive stuff, it all failed me, saying this with respect. This is forever my favorite company and I will stick with this company till the day I die man. Whoever designed & planned this mouse is a an absolute genius and has a ridiculous level of attention to detail."}

I recently got the wireless one as well, and loved it until it stopped working/charging after a month (right outside of the Amazon return window).  The link to the support website through Amazon was not English, so I was struggling to figure out the warranty return, but the seller was great to quickly respond to my Amazon review comment.  They were very apologetic and courteous in offering a replacement.The software for the mouse is easy and intuitive, and I have enjoyed the side buttons a lot.  I use it for MMO (FF14) gaming on PS5 and it works perfectly.  I was a little worried about if the side key customizations would work with the PS5, but they work perfect.  You just plug in the mouse to a PC, customize the side buttons with the included software, and it saves the key combos/macros the the mouse. You can then use the customized buttons wirelessly no problem.Hopefully, it was just bad luck the first time, because it really is otherwise a great product for the price.  The texture, ergonomics, function, and customization are really great for an affordable gaming mouse."}

It'll take a little getting used to but is so easy I almost never touch the number keys on my keyboard.The Shape of the mouse is perfect for most hands and the texture on the mouse is amazing and helps keep the mouse in your hand.No matter how many big falls this mouse has never broken over the years and has been the most durable piece of my computer.As long as this mouse is sold I won't choose anything else.Unbeatable price and those 12 buttons on the side is both the reason I originally got this mouse and the reason I will stick with it for as long as it's sold."}

The configurable sensitivity level rises to the mammoth 16400 DPI. Now that's extraordinary. Playing games like Counter-Strike and League of Legends became a charm once I took the learning curve in stride. The vivid RGB lighting customization is a deserving shout-out, adding the desired aesthetic for late-night gaming sessions.But even Venus had its flaws. Having 12 side buttons brought complexity rather than convenience. Toggling through them during high-paced games could quickly become a strenuous thumb gymnastic. Nevertheless, practicing their use saw an enhancement in performance over time. The 'Auto Fire Button' and easily adjustable weights are delightful editions that make a real difference.Comfort-wise, this mouse fits like a glove. With six years of regular use, it still functioned properly. However, as it's built more for right-handed gamers, Southpaws's gaming populace might need help adapting. Lastly, its price might bog some of the budget players down - but if you look at it as a long-term investment, you'd know it's worth every penny.In absolute terms, the UtechSmart Venus Gaming Mouse has scaled itself respectably in the game. While its comprehensive capabilities might require getting used to it, it offers a bang for the buck deal. For serious gamers, it's not just the finished artifact—it's also about the journey. I'd give it a daring 4.1 out of 5 stars for its fantastic performance garnished with unmissable blemishes."}
{"asin": "B07XP4K152", "username": "Minor Henderson", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nIT'S GREAT (IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SACRIFICE SOME THINGS) [read below]", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2020", "purchased": "Color: classic black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗺𝘆 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲:𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜 𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱: The wired version started double clicking after 3 years of constant use. Also, there's not a lot of affordable options for a wireless MMO mouse. I liked my experience with the original, so I gave this one a shot.𝗙𝗶𝘁: I have small hands, but I wouldn't choose any other mouse over this. Every finger has a place, so I always feel like I have full control. The negative about this mouse compared to the wired version is that the \"pinky slot\" is more caved in. I thought it would make for a more comfortable fit, but it actually causes pinky fatigue.𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: it performs just like the wired version. There are some differences here though. Due to it having a battery, I'll never be able to make it as light weight as the wired version. The \"70 hour\" claim is a little weird. I feel like this is only achievable if you disable the lights (to use less battery). However, I use this mouse all day, and it will last me two days easily before charging. The third day however, I'm only able to get away with \"light\" use. The \"power saving\" does help with this though. Sometimes I may end up cooking in the kitchen or taking a shower, and I don't have to worry about turning off my mouse.𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: Unfortunately it does have the same issues as the previous version. Some buttons are bright, while others are dim. This also means that sometimes the colors don't match. I also found when changing colors in the software it's not nearly as good the wired version. They're not very accurate to the selection you make within the software. To make it all worse, the mouse wheel will usually be a mismatch to the rest of the mouse when changing colors. (not just a shade or two off either, it's a completely different color.) So you're limited to the certain colors if you want everything to be congruent.𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲: This is where this mouse takes a massive hit. Your options are extremely limited. You can't customize a button to \"profile switch\" or reassign the \"dpi\" buttons to something else. This doesn't affect me, because I always use the dpi buttons as dpi buttons anyway. To add fuel to the fire, YOU ONLY HAVE 2 ACTIVE PROFILES INSTEAD OF 5. I have found a work around for this though. Simply make a profile for your each one of your needs. (different games, software, browsers, etc.) You can make as many as you want. Then export each one to the same folder. Repeat the process until you have all your profiles in one folder. Set your main 2 profiles (the ones you use the most) as the ones in use. Then whenever you want to switch just, open the software, go to \"import profile\" and boom (everything that you need will be waiting for you.) I have pictures, showing what I mean.I do this because I have modes for browsing, gaming, and editing. It's a pain at first, but I really don't mind it now. I think it would have been great if you could've imported profiles from the wired version into the wireless software to speed things up. The macro editor feels eh as well. I was able to screenshot with the wired version, that isn't the case with this. Sometimes I feel like the battery % isn't accurate at all. To top it off, I'm pretty sure they have no intentions on updating the software. Which is disappointing.𝗧𝗟;𝗗𝗥 (𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆)𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀:- Great fit- Great performance- Nearly identical to the wired version- wireless, with no latency issues- great battery (heavy use = 2 days, light use = 4+)- affordable- usb-c𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀:- Software is lacking (and I doubt it will be improved)- DPI buttons are NOT customizable- Can only switch between 2 profiles at a time, instead of 5 with the wired version (I mention a work around for this above)- Forced to use the \"profile switch\" button on the bottom the mouse [YOU CANNOT PROGRAM IT TO A BUTTON LIKE OTHER MICE]- Light (in general, not light as in light shades) colors are not accurate(this goes for the actual color, the buttons have varying brightness levels, and the mouse wheel usually doesn't match the other colors when customizing. It's a completely different color)- Macro editor feels clunky [some macros are only available for the wired version, ex: screenshot (win + ps)]- the new shape of the mouse can cause slight fatigue (this may only be my experience)I gave it a 4 stars instead of 3 because I found workarounds for most of my issues. The software is what's really holding it back from a 4.5 - 5 stars."}

On the one hand, it kept the pad fresh-looking for an appreciable time. But on the other hand, it significantly degraded the quality of the pad's cloth and foam rubber over a couple of years I used it.Such deterioration called for a replacement, which was an unexpected and slightly disappointing outcome considering SteelSeries' reputation of providing sturdy gaming accessories. I highly recommend that the brand looks into the durability of the materials used to produce these mouse pads.Despite this, my overall impression of the SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad remains positive due to its slick design, smooth performance, and ease of use. Plus, most game enthusiasts can attest to the typical lifespan of gaming peripherals and agree that this is partially expected. As such, I'm rating it a solid 5/5 for its top-notch gaming optimization job done so beautifully for a considerable time. One can only wish it lasted a bit longer.Being washable is good, too (represented as a unique feature in the specifications), but not if it comes at the expense of the product's lifespan. Users must be cautious about how they keep their gaming gadgetry clean. Minimizing the number of washes and spot cleaning may serve a better purpose. It's excellent, amusing, and perfect for intensive gaming - care for it carefully.Nonetheless, till the time it was functioning at its optimal, this pad served just right for all my gaming needs.

{"asin": "B000UVRU6G", "username": "Aleks P.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat Gaming Accessory with a Limited Lifespan", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023", "purchased": "Size: MediumColor: Classic Black", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I bought the SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad in Classic Black in 2015. Its sleek and smooth design immediately impressed me, which added a great deal to my overall gaming experience. Being optimized for gaming sensors, I found improved precision in my controls that and defiantly enhanced my gaming performance.However, following their maintenance recommendations turned out to be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it kept the pad fresh-looking for an appreciable time. But on the other hand, it significantly degraded the quality of the pad's cloth and foam rubber over a couple of years I used it.Such deterioration called for a replacement, which was an unexpected and slightly disappointing outcome considering SteelSeries' reputation of providing sturdy gaming accessories. I highly recommend that the brand looks into the durability of the materials used to produce these mouse pads.Despite this, my overall impression of the SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad remains positive due to its slick design, smooth performance, and ease of use. Plus, most game enthusiasts can attest to the typical lifespan of gaming peripherals and agree that this is partially expected. As such, I'm rating it a solid 5/5 for its top-notch gaming optimization job done so beautifully for a considerable time. One can only wish it lasted a bit longer.Being washable is good, too (represented as a unique feature in the specifications), but not if it comes at the expense of the product's lifespan. Users must be cautious about how they keep their gaming gadgetry clean. Minimizing the number of washes and spot cleaning may serve a better purpose. It's excellent, amusing, and perfect for intensive gaming - care for it carefully.Nonetheless, till the time it was functioning at its optimal, this pad served just right for all my gaming needs. Consider it for quality gaming, but you might be looking for a potential replacement in a few years. It's a kit that offers a fantastic experience; I wish it could stick around a bit longer. Until then, game on!"}

Tracking performance seems to vary from one pad to the next. The SteelSeries QcK seems to combine the best features of all of them. It measures about 11\" x 12\" (225mm x 300mm), which is larger than any of the others, but still a comfortable size for desktop placement. The larger size minimizes occasions when the mouse sensor runs off the edge of the pad. The pad is about 1/8\" (3.5mm) thick with a bonded (non-stitched) edge and non-skid liner on the bottom. It comes rolled up in a box about 1.5\" x 1.5\" x 12\" long. The innermost part of the roll takes a day or two to flatten out. The glide \"feel\" is among the smoothest of any pad I have, and tracking is good. I'm not a gamer, and none of my mice are so-called \"gaming mice,\" so I can't speak to the pad's performance in that application. For normal office and home computing needs, this pad does the job."}

It does not have stitched edges, so look into the edge version of QcK if that concerns you. Pad does not have any coding, so you can clean this with dishsoap and a soft clean sponge. The only downside is you will probably have to clean this often as it does get dirty sort of fast. Cleaning it will give you that out of the box feel though.

I have been a gamer my whole life. I am currently as of writing this 34 years old. Yeah not a youngin but not an old man either.... I grew up using OG computers with ball mice. Over the years I had gotten a good feel on what makes a good mouse \"in my opinion\" and sadly many mice do not fit the bill. Many will SEEM to fit, only to fail later.My very last mouse was the Razer Viper V2 Pro. And what a freaking mistake that was. I swear I have the worst time with mice. I use my computer at least 8 hours a day mix gaming and non gaming. I had given up on Razer for along time, trying off brands, chinese brands, and so on. But, I wanted a wireless mouse, so I gave Razer a chance. FIVE (5) months after use, the wireless side of the V2 Pro just stopped working for no reason. Legit would not connect. Tried multiple computers, over 20 different usb ports and hubs, it was just dead. Googled the issue and sure enough its a \"common\" issue and everyone with said issue ends up buying a new mouse as replacement. WHAT? I am not going to buy \"another\" Razer of the same model when it freaking failed. Why, so it can fail again in 5 months? I feel bad for people who keep giving these companies with bad practices money.Turn around and I finally ordered this Logitech. EVEN Logitech, I had sworn \"to never use\" because they kept failing in terms of left click. They ALL have the same issue, double click error after long use. You can google that too and find many people complaining of double clicking \"but Logitech has the best wifi connection so no other brand can compare\" thus \"they still buy Logitech.\" So like Razer, I decided to give them a second chance.... This time around, Logitech has given us optical switches, which IN THEORY should never fail in terms of double clicking.... So here I am, using it.Firstly the mouse movement feel 1:1 vs what I see on screen. No I don't mean DPI wise. YES, 1200 DPI on this Logitech feels COMPLETELY different than 1200 DPI on the Razer I was using before it. But I dare say this G502 X Lightspeed is more \"accurate\" and \"stable.\" No matter how fast or slow I move the mouse, the cursor tracks properly and moves the proper amount you expect. Razer was only \"slightly\" worse in this regards where sometimes you felt like \"I didn't aim there\" when moving. It didn't happen often, not as often as 3rd party cheap Chinese mice that's for sure. My go to mouse for a long time was Cooler Master brand, Spawn, Xornet 2, MM720.... I like the wider mouse as I have \"bear paw\" hands (wide hands with short fingers). But those mice have tracking issues. You move fast and the rate at which the mouse moves is different then when you move it slower. And its a huge variation between each speed you move the mouse. Its bad. This G502 X LS is the first to feel accurate like OG mice from back in the day, like the classic Microsoft Intellimouse which was my go to back in the 2000's....The battery life is insane. The razer I would need to charge just about once a week. So far my Logitech seems to \"last forever.\" I ended up buying one of those Soarking Charging Docks for the Logitech mice. Comes with the little POG bottom cover that allows for mounting/charging. And its magnetic. Every once in awhile I just toss it onto that charger while I sleep. I don't really think of it as \"charging\" because it charges while the PC is literally turned off. Which is a huge plus. You could argue \"that's why its lasting longer\" but \"out of the box\" the initial charge lasted me TWO WEEKS before the mouse shut off on me. THAT was when I bought the charging dock.... still two weeks vs one week on the razer is double the time....The only downside is that the left and right click feel, mushy? its a short distance and the click feels, well it feels weird. It doesn't feel like a click, more like a \"clock\" feel. Its hard to explain really. Its not BAD per say, but I like the feedback of other mice where the click feels like an actual click. Mushy is the only way I can explain it. Its still a sharp feeling but mushy at the same time. I'm not good at explaining it.... again its not bad.The scroll wheel also feels janky. I don't understand the \"free wheel\" scroll feature. Why? And when its in the click style turn mode, the \"notchy\" feel, it feels, mushy. I have to say my favorite mouse wheel has been Cooler Master mice. MM720 for example. Best mouse wheel on the market in my opinion.IF I HAVE TO, I will come back an edit my review if something goes wrong. For now ive been using this mouse for over a months, 8 hours a day minimum, and its been flawless for now.On an off note, my DREAM mouse would be Cooler Master optical buttons, Cooler Master scroll wheel, Logitech Wireless technology, Logitech Sensor, and shape can just have multiple shapes to please everyone, a normal one, an ergonomic one that has a high hump, a wide one like my fav CM mice. That mouse would be the mouse to end all mice in my opinion."}

In that time I became accustomed to the particular shape and feel of this mouse, the incredibly intuitive placement of extra buttons, and the surprisingly decent software (which has had its ups and downs over the years but has consistently remained functional for me).I previously avoided upgrades to the G502 Proteus Core because it did everything I needed from a mouse, never broke, never needed a new battery, and was rock solid reliable over USB. But recently I started wondering again if wireless mouse technology had advanced enough to make it competitive with wired.Enter the G502X Lightspeed, my first wireless mouse in over a decade. Overall I like this mouse more than my Proteus Core. The wireless tech has been almost perfectly reliable for me. The only issue I have with it vs a wired variant is that it takes a second to adjust to its settings after waking up from sleep. I’ve had zero dropped inputs or noticeable lag. In this sense, it has been as reliable as I expect a mouse to be and really confirmed the strides there have been in wireless technology. The lack of RGB lights is a welcome change for me. I always kept the blue lighting disabled on my Proteus Core, so to not have any unlit light spots or lighting settings to deal with has been nice for me. Battery life has been great. I use this mouse for about 12 hours a day between work and personal computers and get about 3 weeks between charges. I doubt the battery will let this last as long as my Proteus Core before it needs to be serviced or replaced, but for the benefits of no cord drag, I’m willing to accept that I think. The clicks are a little more hollow-sounding than on the original, but seem to be just as or more accurate. I prefer a heavier mouse, so I slightly miss the heft of the Proteus Core, but I’ve quickly adjusted to the pleasant weight of this mouse which is still a bit heavier than many of its competitors. The slight change in shape is better for my hand and typical palm grip, I can feel the improvement in my ability to reach buttons and in day-long use comfort. The scroll wheel isn’t as substantial, but it still offers a very pleasant endless scroll and a tactile locked scroll feeling.This mouse is a worthy successor to the Proteus Core throne and it does so many things right that its trade-offs are worth it to me. The G502 line continues to be my favorite way to interact with a computer, and I’m glad to see Logitech continuing to improve and commit resources to this great series of mice."}

Though, nothing wrong with the original.With those who do upgrade, expect a similar shape albeit slightly different but nonetheless fits your hand perfectly. I find this mouse to be exemplary for those looking for one mouse to get the job done. This isn't your lightweight fps mouse, but if weight is of no obligation to you, this mouse at 106g is nimble enough for most.What's nice is for you star wars lovers including myself is that you can get this Millennium Falcon version at no upcharge versus the plain black or white. The printing is immaculate and the colored plastics are fantastic and compliment the art design as well.I also feel as this came specific mouse came out almost a year after the original that internal tweaks were performed by Logitech to improve mouse quality. Prior copies have had a very metallic sound to the click with them being hybrid optical switches. I find this batch to have increase quality click and doesn't have the harsh feed back and jarring bottom out feeling when using the mouse.Overall, I am highly impressed with this mouse. And the fact that this mouse feels better the the original batch and themed as the Millennium Falcon at the same price as the other model makes this a no brainer for those Star Wars fans or those going with a Star Wars aesthetic."}
{"asin": "B092CRH1RX", "username": "JKJ", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nFixed almost all my problems with the G502 HERO", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackSize: WirelessStyle: Non-RGBPattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I had a G502 HERO, but wound up hating it due to the awful, slippery, ultra heavy mouse wheel and overall weight. This fixes these problems, and it is now my favorite mouse. It is much lighter overall, and while the wheel is still a bit heavier than I'd like, it requires much less force to scroll in click mode, and has less momentum in free scrolling mode than the HERO. It also has a nice texture rubber surface, instead of the HERO's awful smooth metallish texture.The (separate) wireless charging system also works very well, and pretty much solves the last remaining issue with a wireless mouse.I don't remember if this was a feature of the older versions, but this lets you remove that awful \"Shift\" thumb button, that was always in the way for general use, but still too far from my thumb to reach conveniently. You can now shift it closer, or remove it altogether, which is great.The only major downside is that Logitech's software has unfortunately been overwhelmed with bloat, which used to be one of their major advantages back when LGS (or even SetPoint) was a thing, and this mouse isn't supported by LGS at all. Fortunately they now provide a tool which lets you edit the memory profiles stored on the mouse itself without installing that awful heap of bloatware G HUB or whatever it is called now. It is somewhat limited, particularly as it doesn't support macros but it is enough for most uses, and autohotkey fills in the gaps."}
{"asin": "B092CRH1RX", "username": "J.S.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nG502 X Plus -- A Worthy successor to earlier G502's for FPS games", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022", "purchased": "Color: BlackSize: WirelessStyle: RGBPattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The 2022 Logitech G502 X Plus was a very pleasant surprise.  It is replacing a Logitech G-Pro that is roughly 80 grams weight on a Logitech Powerplay mouse pad (expanded cover for extra space and non-stop charging), primarily used for Overwatch2.  Other gaming mice in my collection include earlier G502's, G903, Razer Death Adder + Copperhead, Steelseries Rival3 and Rival600, etc.  Generally the best performers in FPS games are the lightest units with the best optical sensors, and the G502 X Plus definitely fits that criteria.Pros:-Comfortable ergonomic shape for marathon gaming sessions-PTFE mouse feet for super-smooth glide across mouse pads-The new optical hybrid switches are incredibly fast compared to the G-Pro's older Omron switches, with a nice crisp click and improved actuation.  They will last much longer than conventional mechanical switches and correct double-clicking issues.  My last G-Pro's right rear thumb switch suffered from double-clicking issues since they were the old Omron mechanicals that wore out from constant use.-Nice RGB lighting if you are looking for that kind of bling-This mouse wakes from sleep mode instantly (like the G-Pro series).  The old G502 Hero Wireless required a full second to wake up, making the old sleep mode feature extremely inconvenient and annoying.-At 106 grams list weight, the G502 X Plus is a tad heavier for a gaming mouse. However, coming from an 80 gram G-Pro, I notice better aim stability without sacrificing flick aim consistency.  With the Powerplay charging puck attached and USB receiver stored inside, the G502 X Plus hits 110g on my postal scale.  The G502 Hero wireless is 120g with the same accessories.Cons:-No more adjustable weights like its predecessor G502, but to be fair, the whole e-sport industry has shifted competitive user demand to lighter weight mice for the fastest aim flicks possible.-Battery power drains faster with RGB lighting at full settings.  This is mitigated by reducing RBG brightness to 85% and shortening idle-mode entry from 2 minutes down to 1.  Using a Logitech Powerplay mouse pad, my mouse battery power hovers around 78% to 90% steady with RGB enabled.-The mouse's black finish tends to have shiny oil stains and wear marks over time.  This is why I apply blue painter's tape to the areas most prone to this issue.-GHub software will not allow users less than 3 DPI presets, and all of these have to be different values at 50dpi intervals.  I tried to \"lock\" my mouse at 1000dpi to avoid accidental DPI switching, but the software would not allow me to do this, so I ended up moving my DPI cycling button to the default profile button up top and removing the up/down DPI adjustment buttons next to the left click.  This gave me two additional buttons for other programable functions (like Alt and middle-mouse click since pressing the mouse wheel down can feel awkward).-The new hybrid mechanical switches have a different click sound compared to conventional switches -- not really louder, but definitely more metallic.Yes, this mouse is expensive, but the combination of lighter weight + excellent ergonomics + fast/crisp long-wear switches makes this model very hard to beat.  If you are looking for a mouse with more weight and heft, then you may not be happy with the G502 X since the latest model has been redesigned for the e-sports crowd.  The G502 X now combines lighter weight with an ergo shape, something that most ultra-light mouse offerings lack.NOTE:  If you want the best wireless mouse experience, I recommend pairing the G502 X Plus with a Logitech Powerplay for non-stop wireless charging while using the mouse.  For those that want a larger mouse pad than what the default Powerplay size offers, check out \"Logitech powerplay mousepad expansion mod\" on youtube.  I have my set-up displayed in the attached images along with actual weight compared to the old G502 Wireless.  Update 4/26/2023:  The Glorious XL mousepad is the perfect thickness for this Powerplay expansion mod.EDIT:  I just read a few other reviews claiming that the G502 X feels \"cheap\" because it feels too light.  The whole point of lowering mouse weight is to minimize mass, thereby requiring less physical energy / effort to move the mouse quickly and accurately.  This is how modern e-sports mice are designed, because a lighter mouse is a faster mouse, while a heavier one is a slower boat anchor that is usually on the losing end of an FPS fire fight.  The G502 X Plus is only 10 grams lighter than the G502 hero, yet it is much easier to flick-aim than the older G502 Hero Wireless.Also, if you want RGB on the G502 X, you have to get the Plus edition, other wise you get no RGB.  Yet one newer review complained about missing RGB LED's on his G502 X non-Plus edition.  Going no-RGB is still a valid choice since it saves a few grams, extends battery life, and costs less, but just make sure you know what you are buying ahead of time.  ;)"}

Didn't have prior experience with the g502 hero and was always a fan of the 4 top button so I later transition to roccat tyon which is a bit larger and heavier (130gish) mouse that is d/c now.  So this would mainly be my baseline comparison.I been debating between all three version and didn't want to cough up money for powerplay as well for the RBG version so got the wireless non-RGB one.  The old g502 lightspeed (non-x) wireless version was going for $80 but mechanical button (not optic) and was more in my price range.  The wired version had cheap rubber wire that apparently rubbed against the mouse pad.  I have been mostly in the \"wired\" club cause of latency and battery concern before. Going to transition to wireless club now.Pro:- 144 hours per ghub which is amazing which is 6 full days.  If I use it 8hrs a day, that 18 days before I have to recharged.  Usage is more close to 3hr on weekday and 12 on weekend so it should last a month for me.  RGB version is like 30ish hours and that was my deciding factor w/o powerplay.- Apparently only takes ~2 hour to charge to full- Love the wireless, pretty much no lag at all with the dongle.  Simply plug and play, and ghub software download via google.- Many keybinding.  I have like 18 keybinding by utilizing the G-shift key (bind it to the DPI+shift button) for office work profile.  This is similar to the roccat easy shift which was by the thumb rest.- USB-C charging.  Did not even use the dongle extension hub.  Will just use my android super charger next to my PC every-25K DPI but who really would use this?  I try to set my window sensitivity to lowest with 25k and that not happening.  Rolling at window sensitivity 6 with 5500 DPI and 4 other DPI level for shifting.-1000Hz Polling-106g weight or so per description.  Felt nice and it is gliding on my old logitech mousepad with those new white padding.-Battery LED in center front of mouse.  Can keybind to activate the battery level color.Con:- Coming from the roccat tyon, it was a bit smaller for me and had hand discomfort. Hoping to adjust soon.-Scroll wheel (non-release): a bit louder for personal preference.  Like if I'm scrolling down a page, it would go through like 3-4 of the tactile clicks.  End up changing mouse setting to increase # of line per scroll to like 20.-Scroll wheel (infinite scroll): I always loved this when I had the g700.  This one, is nice for web page scrolling initially but as my finger tend to be on the scroll wheel, everytime that I stop, the page would scroll up a bit then back down again which is annoying.-Keybinded new tab / close tab with scroll left and right.  Problem is that, the function is ctrl+T / ctrl+W.  This ctrl button + scroll wheel = zoom in/out.  As I often navigate through many tab at once, it would occasionally perform unwanted zooming.Neutral-Would like to have button on the top right side as well.-No RGB but I wasn't going pay like $15 extra for that plus your hand would cover like 90% of the light area.-Still not getting use to the mouse click.  With the new optic switch, it supposedly will prevent \"double-clicking\" issue.  Either I am clicking it too lightly and I do get the feeling of \"I did double click, but it not opening\" since the file is clearly highlighted.  Cause it is a bit smaller to my previous mouse, I notice I'm doing more of a claw grip instead of palm grip so my finger are pressing around 3/5 way of the button so this may be the reason.- Content of box: Mouse, USB cable, dongle, dongle extender, DPI shift button cover and bunch of user guide.-I feel like I got cheated a bit as it seems like I may have gotten a new returned and opened boxes.  There was no plastic wrap and the box was inside a heatsealed plastic bag and the bottom of the mouse was a bit dusty which came off.  I was still impress with the mouse so going ignore the hassle of returning and will be keeping it.Overall: Definitely worth it to get the wireless non-RGB version for me.  If you have powerplay then the RGB version may be for you if you want lighting."}

That old mouse still worked perfectly (after 7 years of punishment) but it looked very worn out so I went for this new wireless version. This new mouse exceeded my expectations. The weight difference is MASSIVE. Before the change I used to get wrist pain after playing for a few hours, I even thought I had carpal tunnel syndrome (chronic wrist pain). Nevertheless after the change to the new mouse the pain is totally gone, I guess the lower weight is the reason.I also like the new design. It is sleeker and most importantly it catches considerably less dirt than the old one. The way the buttons click and feel is also very sweet, I even like it more than the old version. At the beginning I was a little doubtful about getting a wireless mouse, since I thought that charging it would be annoying. I was wrong though, the battery lasts around 5 weeks (Using my PC 5 hours a day on average) and it charges relatively quickly, so the benefit of enjoying wireless freedom far outweights the need to charge it once in a while.The logitech app to configure the mouse is not the best in the market, but for me it works fine. I really don't care about the lack of RGB and if it had RGB I would have it off anyways since it drains the battery extreamly quickly."}

I have a wired Hero currently and have been through about 5 different mice because of button failures.  However, the Hero version has never failed on me.  I wanted to get a wireless mouse, so I bought this.  I personally think it's a step backwards.  The DPI UP/DOWN buttons are better, but the scroll wheel is a step back in my opinion.  There is no weight to it and when you want it to roll without resistance it's much harder to get going because it feels flimsy.  Also, that is the main issue with this mouse for me, its weight the thing is way to light and there is no way to add weight to it.  It makes the thing feel flimsy and this for a premium?  What were they thinking, I will probably just order the wireless Hero version and return this mouse.  I do like the DPI button change, but for me that is the only plus that this mouse brings to the table.Edit:  After a few days with the mouse it's actually quite good.

It didn't happen often, not as often as 3rd party cheap Chinese mice that's for sure. My go to mouse for a long time was Cooler Master brand, Spawn, Xornet 2, MM720.... I like the wider mouse as I have \"bear paw\" hands (wide hands with short fingers). But those mice have tracking issues. You move fast and the rate at which the mouse moves is different then when you move it slower. And its a huge variation between each speed you move the mouse. Its bad. This G502 X LS is the first to feel accurate like OG mice from back in the day, like the classic Microsoft Intellimouse which was my go to back in the 2000's....The battery life is insane. The razer I would need to charge just about once a week. So far my Logitech seems to \"last forever.\" I ended up buying one of those Soarking Charging Docks for the Logitech mice. Comes with the little POG bottom cover that allows for mounting/charging. And its magnetic. Every once in awhile I just toss it onto that charger while I sleep. I don't really think of it as \"charging\" because it charges while the PC is literally turned off. Which is a huge plus. You could argue \"that's why its lasting longer\" but \"out of the box\" the initial charge lasted me TWO WEEKS before the mouse shut off on me. THAT was when I bought the charging dock.... still two weeks vs one week on the razer is double the time....The only downside is that the left and right click feel, mushy? its a short distance and the click feels, well it feels weird. It doesn't feel like a click, more like a \"clock\" feel. Its hard to explain really. Its not BAD per say, but I like the feedback of other mice where the click feels like an actual click. Mushy is the only way I can explain it. Its still a sharp feeling but mushy at the same time. I'm not good at explaining it.... again its not bad.The scroll wheel also feels janky. I don't understand the \"free wheel\" scroll feature. Why? And when its in the click style turn mode, the \"notchy\" feel, it feels, mushy. I have to say my favorite mouse wheel has been Cooler Master mice. MM720 for example. Best mouse wheel on the market in my opinion.IF I HAVE TO, I will come back an edit my review if something goes wrong. For now ive been using this mouse for over a months, 8 hours a day minimum, and its been flawless for now.On an off note, my DREAM mouse would be Cooler Master optical buttons, Cooler Master scroll wheel, Logitech Wireless technology, Logitech Sensor, and shape can just have multiple shapes to please everyone, a normal one, an ergonomic one that has a high hump, a wide one like my fav CM mice. That mouse would be the mouse to end all mice in my opinion."}

In that time I became accustomed to the particular shape and feel of this mouse, the incredibly intuitive placement of extra buttons, and the surprisingly decent software (which has had its ups and downs over the years but has consistently remained functional for me).I previously avoided upgrades to the G502 Proteus Core because it did everything I needed from a mouse, never broke, never needed a new battery, and was rock solid reliable over USB. But recently I started wondering again if wireless mouse technology had advanced enough to make it competitive with wired.Enter the G502X Lightspeed, my first wireless mouse in over a decade. Overall I like this mouse more than my Proteus Core. The wireless tech has been almost perfectly reliable for me. The only issue I have with it vs a wired variant is that it takes a second to adjust to its settings after waking up from sleep. I’ve had zero dropped inputs or noticeable lag. In this sense, it has been as reliable as I expect a mouse to be and really confirmed the strides there have been in wireless technology. The lack of RGB lights is a welcome change for me. I always kept the blue lighting disabled on my Proteus Core, so to not have any unlit light spots or lighting settings to deal with has been nice for me. Battery life has been great. I use this mouse for about 12 hours a day between work and personal computers and get about 3 weeks between charges. I doubt the battery will let this last as long as my Proteus Core before it needs to be serviced or replaced, but for the benefits of no cord drag, I’m willing to accept that I think. The clicks are a little more hollow-sounding than on the original, but seem to be just as or more accurate. I prefer a heavier mouse, so I slightly miss the heft of the Proteus Core, but I’ve quickly adjusted to the pleasant weight of this mouse which is still a bit heavier than many of its competitors. The slight change in shape is better for my hand and typical palm grip, I can feel the improvement in my ability to reach buttons and in day-long use comfort. The scroll wheel isn’t as substantial, but it still offers a very pleasant endless scroll and a tactile locked scroll feeling.This mouse is a worthy successor to the Proteus Core throne and it does so many things right that its trade-offs are worth it to me. The G502 line continues to be my favorite way to interact with a computer, and I’m glad to see Logitech continuing to improve and commit resources to this great series of mice."}

Though, nothing wrong with the original.With those who do upgrade, expect a similar shape albeit slightly different but nonetheless fits your hand perfectly. I find this mouse to be exemplary for those looking for one mouse to get the job done. This isn't your lightweight fps mouse, but if weight is of no obligation to you, this mouse at 106g is nimble enough for most.What's nice is for you star wars lovers including myself is that you can get this Millennium Falcon version at no upcharge versus the plain black or white. The printing is immaculate and the colored plastics are fantastic and compliment the art design as well.I also feel as this came specific mouse came out almost a year after the original that internal tweaks were performed by Logitech to improve mouse quality. Prior copies have had a very metallic sound to the click with them being hybrid optical switches. I find this batch to have increase quality click and doesn't have the harsh feed back and jarring bottom out feeling when using the mouse.Overall, I am highly impressed with this mouse. And the fact that this mouse feels better the the original batch and themed as the Millennium Falcon at the same price as the other model makes this a no brainer for those Star Wars fans or those going with a Star Wars aesthetic."}
{"asin": "B092CRH1RX", "username": "JKJ", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nFixed almost all my problems with the G502 HERO", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackSize: WirelessStyle: Non-RGBPattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I had a G502 HERO, but wound up hating it due to the awful, slippery, ultra heavy mouse wheel and overall weight. This fixes these problems, and it is now my favorite mouse. It is much lighter overall, and while the wheel is still a bit heavier than I'd like, it requires much less force to scroll in click mode, and has less momentum in free scrolling mode than the HERO. It also has a nice texture rubber surface, instead of the HERO's awful smooth metallish texture.The (separate) wireless charging system also works very well, and pretty much solves the last remaining issue with a wireless mouse.I don't remember if this was a feature of the older versions, but this lets you remove that awful \"Shift\" thumb button, that was always in the way for general use, but still too far from my thumb to reach conveniently. You can now shift it closer, or remove it altogether, which is great.The only major downside is that Logitech's software has unfortunately been overwhelmed with bloat, which used to be one of their major advantages back when LGS (or even SetPoint) was a thing, and this mouse isn't supported by LGS at all. Fortunately they now provide a tool which lets you edit the memory profiles stored on the mouse itself without installing that awful heap of bloatware G HUB or whatever it is called now. It is somewhat limited, particularly as it doesn't support macros but it is enough for most uses, and autohotkey fills in the gaps."}
{"asin": "B092CRH1RX", "username": "J.S.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nG502 X Plus -- A Worthy successor to earlier G502's for FPS games", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022", "purchased": "Color: BlackSize: WirelessStyle: RGBPattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The 2022 Logitech G502 X Plus was a very pleasant surprise.  It is replacing a Logitech G-Pro that is roughly 80 grams weight on a Logitech Powerplay mouse pad (expanded cover for extra space and non-stop charging), primarily used for Overwatch2.  Other gaming mice in my collection include earlier G502's, G903, Razer Death Adder + Copperhead, Steelseries Rival3 and Rival600, etc.  Generally the best performers in FPS games are the lightest units with the best optical sensors, and the G502 X Plus definitely fits that criteria.Pros:-Comfortable ergonomic shape for marathon gaming sessions-PTFE mouse feet for super-smooth glide across mouse pads-The new optical hybrid switches are incredibly fast compared to the G-Pro's older Omron switches, with a nice crisp click and improved actuation.  They will last much longer than conventional mechanical switches and correct double-clicking issues.  My last G-Pro's right rear thumb switch suffered from double-clicking issues since they were the old Omron mechanicals that wore out from constant use.-Nice RGB lighting if you are looking for that kind of bling-This mouse wakes from sleep mode instantly (like the G-Pro series).  The old G502 Hero Wireless required a full second to wake up, making the old sleep mode feature extremely inconvenient and annoying.-At 106 grams list weight, the G502 X Plus is a tad heavier for a gaming mouse. However, coming from an 80 gram G-Pro, I notice better aim stability without sacrificing flick aim consistency.  With the Powerplay charging puck attached and USB receiver stored inside, the G502 X Plus hits 110g on my postal scale.  The G502 Hero wireless is 120g with the same accessories.Cons:-No more adjustable weights like its predecessor G502, but to be fair, the whole e-sport industry has shifted competitive user demand to lighter weight mice for the fastest aim flicks possible.-Battery power drains faster with RGB lighting at full settings.  This is mitigated by reducing RBG brightness to 85% and shortening idle-mode entry from 2 minutes down to 1.  Using a Logitech Powerplay mouse pad, my mouse battery power hovers around 78% to 90% steady with RGB enabled.-The mouse's black finish tends to have shiny oil stains and wear marks over time.  This is why I apply blue painter's tape to the areas most prone to this issue.-GHub software will not allow users less than 3 DPI presets, and all of these have to be different values at 50dpi intervals.  I tried to \"lock\" my mouse at 1000dpi to avoid accidental DPI switching, but the software would not allow me to do this, so I ended up moving my DPI cycling button to the default profile button up top and removing the up/down DPI adjustment buttons next to the left click.  This gave me two additional buttons for other programable functions (like Alt and middle-mouse click since pressing the mouse wheel down can feel awkward).-The new hybrid mechanical switches have a different click sound compared to conventional switches -- not really louder, but definitely more metallic.Yes, this mouse is expensive, but the combination of lighter weight + excellent ergonomics + fast/crisp long-wear switches makes this model very hard to beat.  If you are looking for a mouse with more weight and heft, then you may not be happy with the G502 X since the latest model has been redesigned for the e-sports crowd.  The G502 X now combines lighter weight with an ergo shape, something that most ultra-light mouse offerings lack.NOTE:  If you want the best wireless mouse experience, I recommend pairing the G502 X Plus with a Logitech Powerplay for non-stop wireless charging while using the mouse.  For those that want a larger mouse pad than what the default Powerplay size offers, check out \"Logitech powerplay mousepad expansion mod\" on youtube.  I have my set-up displayed in the attached images along with actual weight compared to the old G502 Wireless.  Update 4/26/2023:  The Glorious XL mousepad is the perfect thickness for this Powerplay expansion mod.EDIT:  I just read a few other reviews claiming that the G502 X feels \"cheap\" because it feels too light.  The whole point of lowering mouse weight is to minimize mass, thereby requiring less physical energy / effort to move the mouse quickly and accurately.  This is how modern e-sports mice are designed, because a lighter mouse is a faster mouse, while a heavier one is a slower boat anchor that is usually on the losing end of an FPS fire fight.  The G502 X Plus is only 10 grams lighter than the G502 hero, yet it is much easier to flick-aim than the older G502 Hero Wireless.Also, if you want RGB on the G502 X, you have to get the Plus edition, other wise you get no RGB.  Yet one newer review complained about missing RGB LED's on his G502 X non-Plus edition.  Going no-RGB is still a valid choice since it saves a few grams, extends battery life, and costs less, but just make sure you know what you are buying ahead of time.  ;)"}

Didn't have prior experience with the g502 hero and was always a fan of the 4 top button so I later transition to roccat tyon which is a bit larger and heavier (130gish) mouse that is d/c now.  So this would mainly be my baseline comparison.I been debating between all three version and didn't want to cough up money for powerplay as well for the RBG version so got the wireless non-RGB one.  The old g502 lightspeed (non-x) wireless version was going for $80 but mechanical button (not optic) and was more in my price range.  The wired version had cheap rubber wire that apparently rubbed against the mouse pad.  I have been mostly in the \"wired\" club cause of latency and battery concern before. Going to transition to wireless club now.Pro:- 144 hours per ghub which is amazing which is 6 full days.  If I use it 8hrs a day, that 18 days before I have to recharged.  Usage is more close to 3hr on weekday and 12 on weekend so it should last a month for me.  RGB version is like 30ish hours and that was my deciding factor w/o powerplay.- Apparently only takes ~2 hour to charge to full- Love the wireless, pretty much no lag at all with the dongle.  Simply plug and play, and ghub software download via google.- Many keybinding.  I have like 18 keybinding by utilizing the G-shift key (bind it to the DPI+shift button) for office work profile.  This is similar to the roccat easy shift which was by the thumb rest.- USB-C charging.  Did not even use the dongle extension hub.  Will just use my android super charger next to my PC every-25K DPI but who really would use this?  I try to set my window sensitivity to lowest with 25k and that not happening.  Rolling at window sensitivity 6 with 5500 DPI and 4 other DPI level for shifting.-1000Hz Polling-106g weight or so per description.  Felt nice and it is gliding on my old logitech mousepad with those new white padding.-Battery LED in center front of mouse.  Can keybind to activate the battery level color.Con:- Coming from the roccat tyon, it was a bit smaller for me and had hand discomfort. Hoping to adjust soon.-Scroll wheel (non-release): a bit louder for personal preference.  Like if I'm scrolling down a page, it would go through like 3-4 of the tactile clicks.  End up changing mouse setting to increase # of line per scroll to like 20.-Scroll wheel (infinite scroll): I always loved this when I had the g700.  This one, is nice for web page scrolling initially but as my finger tend to be on the scroll wheel, everytime that I stop, the page would scroll up a bit then back down again which is annoying.-Keybinded new tab / close tab with scroll left and right.  Problem is that, the function is ctrl+T / ctrl+W.  This ctrl button + scroll wheel = zoom in/out.  As I often navigate through many tab at once, it would occasionally perform unwanted zooming.Neutral-Would like to have button on the top right side as well.-No RGB but I wasn't going pay like $15 extra for that plus your hand would cover like 90% of the light area.-Still not getting use to the mouse click.  With the new optic switch, it supposedly will prevent \"double-clicking\" issue.  Either I am clicking it too lightly and I do get the feeling of \"I did double click, but it not opening\" since the file is clearly highlighted.  Cause it is a bit smaller to my previous mouse, I notice I'm doing more of a claw grip instead of palm grip so my finger are pressing around 3/5 way of the button so this may be the reason.- Content of box: Mouse, USB cable, dongle, dongle extender, DPI shift button cover and bunch of user guide.-I feel like I got cheated a bit as it seems like I may have gotten a new returned and opened boxes.  There was no plastic wrap and the box was inside a heatsealed plastic bag and the bottom of the mouse was a bit dusty which came off.  I was still impress with the mouse so going ignore the hassle of returning and will be keeping it.Overall: Definitely worth it to get the wireless non-RGB version for me.  If you have powerplay then the RGB version may be for you if you want lighting."}

That old mouse still worked perfectly (after 7 years of punishment) but it looked very worn out so I went for this new wireless version. This new mouse exceeded my expectations. The weight difference is MASSIVE. Before the change I used to get wrist pain after playing for a few hours, I even thought I had carpal tunnel syndrome (chronic wrist pain). Nevertheless after the change to the new mouse the pain is totally gone, I guess the lower weight is the reason.I also like the new design. It is sleeker and most importantly it catches considerably less dirt than the old one. The way the buttons click and feel is also very sweet, I even like it more than the old version. At the beginning I was a little doubtful about getting a wireless mouse, since I thought that charging it would be annoying. I was wrong though, the battery lasts around 5 weeks (Using my PC 5 hours a day on average) and it charges relatively quickly, so the benefit of enjoying wireless freedom far outweights the need to charge it once in a while.The logitech app to configure the mouse is not the best in the market, but for me it works fine. I really don't care about the lack of RGB and if it had RGB I would have it off anyways since it drains the battery extreamly quickly."}

I have a wired Hero currently and have been through about 5 different mice because of button failures.  However, the Hero version has never failed on me.  I wanted to get a wireless mouse, so I bought this.  I personally think it's a step backwards.  The DPI UP/DOWN buttons are better, but the scroll wheel is a step back in my opinion.  There is no weight to it and when you want it to roll without resistance it's much harder to get going because it feels flimsy.  Also, that is the main issue with this mouse for me, its weight the thing is way to light and there is no way to add weight to it.  It makes the thing feel flimsy and this for a premium?  What were they thinking, I will probably just order the wireless Hero version and return this mouse.  I do like the DPI button change, but for me that is the only plus that this mouse brings to the table.Edit:  After a few days with the mouse it's actually quite good.

I've never experienced a moment of lag or had the mouse disconnect.-The \"infinite-scroll\" scroll wheel is awesome to have on this mouse, especially as a frequent MX Master user.-The buttons feel great and work consistently.-The battery lasts me for weeks with consistent heavy usage (with LEDs off)-USB-C ChargingCONS:-Expensive. Like, really expensive. There are plenty of other mice that absolutely destroy this mouse in price-to-performance.-Poor battery life with LEDs on. One of the main reasons I switched to this mouse from the Razer Viper Ultimate I was using was the poor battery life of the Viper (with LEDs on). The G502 definitely outperforms the Viper in terms of battery life (With LEDs on), but still will only last me a few days with heavy usage. I've since turned the LEDs off and have had incredible battery life.-Heavy. This is by no means a lightweight mouse. It comes with extra optional weights that you can add to the mouse, but they make an already heavy mouse even heavier. I personally don't love super lightweight mice, and the G502 without the weights is about the perfect weight for me. However, I know many people prefer lightweight mice over heavy ones.Overall, this is a fantastic mouse, and I expect to continue to use it for years to come. This is a big step up in quality from their G502 Hero mouse. I have used several of them in the past, and they've always just felt cheap to me.

I've had several of them over the years, but this one is by far my favorite.PROS:-The design of the mouse is great (in my opinion)-Premium build quality.-It fits my hand perfectly and is extremely comfortable for long-term use.-It glides across my desk with ease.-Logitech's Lightspeed Wireless technology is great. I've never experienced a moment of lag or had the mouse disconnect.-The \"infinite-scroll\" scroll wheel is awesome to have on this mouse, especially as a frequent MX Master user.-The buttons feel great and work consistently.-The battery lasts me for weeks with consistent heavy usage (with LEDs off)-USB-C ChargingCONS:-Expensive. Like, really expensive. There are plenty of other mice that absolutely destroy this mouse in price-to-performance.-Poor battery life with LEDs on. One of the main reasons I switched to this mouse from the Razer Viper Ultimate I was using was the poor battery life of the Viper (with LEDs on). The G502 definitely outperforms the Viper in terms of battery life (With LEDs on), but still will only last me a few days with heavy usage. I've since turned the LEDs off and have had incredible battery life.-Heavy. This is by no means a lightweight mouse. It comes with extra optional weights that you can add to the mouse, but they make an already heavy mouse even heavier. I personally don't love super lightweight mice, and the G502 without the weights is about the perfect weight for me. However, I know many people prefer lightweight mice over heavy ones.Overall, this is a fantastic mouse, and I expect to continue to use it for years to come. This is a big step up in quality from their G502 Hero mouse. I have used several of them in the past, and they've always just felt cheap to me. This mouse feels premium but also has a premium price tag."}

The switches are a bit different, than the older models as well, but I wouldn't say it's better or worse. Build quality seems better on the new mice. Compared to the wired version of the mouse, I notice zero performance difference. My only complaint is that the dongle for the mouse has to be relatively close to the mouse. They provde a long USB extension cable in the package, so you should be able to work it into your setup. I have the receiver for mine right behind the monitor and do not have issues, but did have some connectivity problems when it was plugged straight into the back of the PC a few feet away."}

I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.*Packaging*For a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.*Opening*So once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle  but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.*Package Contents*The package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.*The Mouse*The mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.*Installation*So the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware  no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.*The feels*So I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.*Tracking*So this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.*Conclusion*I was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy."}

Incredible mouse. I have to say I'm incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.That is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that \"break-in\" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.It's how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can \"tell\" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn't feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you're breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.----Old Review----I honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I'm a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I'm very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the \"hand feel\" of the mouse. If they don't make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.The problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.Now, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don't care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn't care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you're trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.However, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar's hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.So what are the benefits? I'm far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there's no strange \"glide\" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can't emphasize this enough, the fact I can't tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.I have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn't even want to consider going back. That's how good it felt to use this thing.I'm going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don't have another one with this issue. If I don't have any further issues, I will update this review."}

I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.The build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port.

I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.*Packaging*For a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.*Opening*So once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle  but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.*Package Contents*The package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.*The Mouse*The mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.*Installation*So the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware  no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.*The feels*So I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.*Tracking*So this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.*Conclusion*I was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy."}

Incredible mouse. I have to say I'm incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.That is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that \"break-in\" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.It's how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can \"tell\" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn't feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you're breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.----Old Review----I honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I'm a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I'm very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the \"hand feel\" of the mouse. If they don't make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.The problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.Now, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don't care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn't care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you're trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.However, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar's hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.So what are the benefits? I'm far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there's no strange \"glide\" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can't emphasize this enough, the fact I can't tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.I have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn't even want to consider going back. That's how good it felt to use this thing.I'm going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don't have another one with this issue. If I don't have any further issues, I will update this review."}

I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.The build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port. It will not come out when charging and playing and will not change the responsiveness which is really good for wireless. I keep mine on my bungie for quick access and so that I don't notice the wire when using the mouse. This mouse is also ambidextrous so leftys can also use it by swapping out the buttons on the side as it comes setup for right handed users.Logitech is really ahead of the game and has sort of set themselves apart from the competition in the recent years when it comes to wireless gaming, there is not any lag or delay and it is just as responsive as a wired mouse.

I use the wire/charger it came with, plugged it into my laptop and it charges and works at the same time. Thank you Logitech! I have small hands and I'm coming from the G305 Lightspeed which worked very well with me, but ran on a removable battery. I found the G Pro and was wondering if it was useable while plugged in (it is) but I purchased it anyway because 1. it's rechargeable and 2. It's the LoL edition which is one of fav games. The mouse is very light, it's lighter then my g305 lightspeed which was a pleasant surprise. It's also bigger than my lightspeed but it fits my hand perfectly. It actually fits a lot better which is awesome. I love the gold hextech accents because they shimmer in the light and they match my realms of runeterra book. The lmb and rmb are very fast when pressing so playing games was a totally different experience. Lastly I think this is well worth the $70. I finally found a mouse that will last me a long time."}

But when I got it, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it fit my hand. The first mouse I've tried that isn't too small.I'm right-handed but the mouse is symmetrical and the side buttons allow left handed support as well. The only con with this mouse is that it doesn't have a lot of mouse buttons which for some people who are used to having a lot, this can take some getting used to. Also includes a small secret compartment for you to put a secret note for yourself or someone else to find in the future.Battery Life.The battery life is amazing, most the time, I completely forget it needs charging at all. I'd say I have to charge it once a week and I'm on my computer using it constantly. Whenever it does need to charge, its a simple plug and continue using it, it also charges fast.Response TimeFor me, at least, there's no delay in response time compared to a wired mouse and you have options for the mouse to be able to be as close as possible to the wireless connecter to ensure its as fast as possible. (Also doubles as a charging cable making that easier as well)Logitech supplies a optional software for additional customization, which honestly makes the mouse even better. From macros to lighting patterns. My favorite lighting option is the one that changes the brightness based on the sound. Fun and neat feature."}

I dont think they are exagerating that 64 hour battery life at all (I AM using it w/o the RGB lighting, as the Logitech app said it would cut my time down from 64 hours to 50-52 hours, and I would rather have the extra 12 hours game time than have some light underneath my palm where I cant see it).The mouse is big (I have large hands), but not as big as the steelseries rival (original) is. That is what I am moving on from, the original steelseries rival. Compared to that, it is 'almost' as long as the rival, and as high as the rival in the center, but I wish it was bigger in the rear end side, as it is a little thin at the back for my taste, which means I have to move it more than I would like to, and I 'feel' it under my palm. It is by no means a deal breaker though, as I have been using it for  only 5 hours and it already feels VERY natural to me. I can hardly tell I am using a new mouse, except for that thin-ness at the rear.The mouse is VERY lightweight. So, if you people that like a heavy mouse, or like adding weights into a mouse, you are out of lick with this mouse. You 'may' be able to add weights in the rear compartment, meant for storing the cable, but other than that, I think you are out of luck. But, dont discount it because of the weight. My rival mouse was a lot heavier, and I thought I was not going to like this logitech mouse because it IS so lightweight, but I was wrong. I dont mind the weight, and I actually am lifting the mouse a lot less than I used to lift my rival mouse. Heh.The wireless thing is NOT a joke! It truly is just as good as my preferred wired mouse, and its ten times better than any other wireless mouse I have ever used, easily better. It is also just as good hit-scan wise as THE best, most accurate mouse I have ever used, the Logitech G100S. And, that is WITH being wireless!If you have the money, dont even think about it, just buy the mouse. I was thinking this would be another return mouse, and I would have to use one of my backup mice instead, like my zowie 1k. But nope, this mouse is not going back. It will be my primary mouse until it dies (which hopefully wont be until an even better version of this mouse is out). I dont know how they could improve on the mouse, unless they make the battery life even longer, or make it more precise than it already is, except to make it a tiny bit fatter in the rear of the mouse, for people who use a true  palm grip, and they make it JUST a palm grip mouse instead of both claw and palm grips. But, that is my opinion, others like claw grips better, and I think this would work well for anyone who uses claw grip also, just becasue of that slim rear end.I cant say enough good things about this mouse to actually make you buy it, but trust me, this IS the mouse you always wanted, have been waiting for forever to cut the cord, and it is right here, right now, available to everyone. No gimmick, just pure kick butt mouse."}

Fantastic upgrade from my previous mouse.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2022", "purchased": "Color: BlackPattern Name: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I have had those little mice that are like $20 that you can find at any store before from Logitech and they have been OK and have served their purpose but when I came to gaming mice I always used wired mice specifically those from corsair. Getting this mouse has made my experience using my PC in both gaming and non-gaming applications significantly better.This mouse is extremely lightweight, holds a charge all day, and has durable sensors from my experience.It might be just a Windows 10 thing but I have noticed that if I turn off my computer and turn off my mouse at the end of the night windows will sometimes awake from sleep. My strategy to mitigate this has been to plug in the mouse, then tell my PC to go into sleep mode, and then while it is going into sleep mode I flip the mouse over and turn it off. Doing this has led to my computer not a waking from sleep in the middle of the night as it has done previously with other mice and my mouse is still able to charge.I charge this mouse every night when I go to sleep and I use the mouse pretty much from 8 AM to 10 PM most days of the week with maybe an hour in that timeframe where I am idle. It has never died on me during use.One drawback that I would say this mouse does have however are the stock feet which are not bad but I would recommend upgrading as you can get a decent pair of aftermarket feet for $20 or so with a noticeable difference in smoothness.Another one and probably the most problematic for all users who care about looks is the finish of the mouse. The mouse has a somewhat map finish which looks great until you touch it. The area where my thumb and pointer finger rest are permanently shiny. I realize that this mouse is made out of ABS plastic which is prone to shining overtime but these areas of my mouse shined faster than the ABS key caps that I use. It’s not that I ate some greasy food or anything just the oils in my hands have caused this thing to shine, despite trying to clean it after I observed the initial shining taking place. Personally, I don’t care that much about it as my hand is normally on top of it anyways but some people may be concerned with that.Those are really the only two complaints I have about this mouse and the pros vastly outweigh the cons. I purchased this mouse for around US$100 so if you can get it for that or less I would say it is worth the money."}

It is a great gaming mouse and I really recommend it especially if it is on sell. You can also use this mouse wireless or wired as in the video in picture I included. The battery life is pretty good but from the reviews I thought it was going to be alot longer. But I don't play the game all the time so that's alright because you can just charge it.

I have small hands and I'm coming from the G305 Lightspeed which worked very well with me, but ran on a removable battery. I found the G Pro and was wondering if it was useable while plugged in (it is) but I purchased it anyway because 1. it's rechargeable and 2. It's the LoL edition which is one of fav games. The mouse is very light, it's lighter then my g305 lightspeed which was a pleasant surprise. It's also bigger than my lightspeed but it fits my hand perfectly.

I've owned many Logitech and Razer mouses that have cost 2-4 times what this mouse does, and none of them have been any better.

I've only had this one for a couple weeks, but if it lasts a year, it was money well spent.The good.Tracks perfectly. Very comfortable. Many buttons. Wired and wireless. Adjustable DPI. Easy to use macro software. RGB can be turned off or customized. All the buttons are recognized by Windows out of the box. The 1-12 buttons are programmed as keyboard 1-9, 0, and +, -.

Some people complain about no Bluetooth, but the 2.4 ghz works perfectly in my setup.

Some say it's hard to pick up to recenter the cursor, but that has not been the case for me.Overall.This is an outstanding mouse, especially at the price point. I would certainly buy it again. However, after some use, I would maybe prefer the version that only has 8 side buttons (plus forward and back buttons).  My only gripe is that the 12 side buttons are small and hard to orient my tumb on the desired button without glancing at the mouse first. The model with 8 side buttons looks a little easier to navigate as the buttons are more spaced apart. Ignore the comments about the macro software. It's easy to use if you've ever programmed macros before. Even if you haven't, there are short YouTube videos that walk you through the process if you need them.If you want a multi button, multi function, high DPI, programmable gaming mouse at a great price, this is it.

But... every now and then I'd play a game that I just really needed some sorta hotkey or macro thing but it was too annoying to have to bind and rebind the mouse buttons or rebind all my keys just to have to rebind them again after reinstalling or I couldn't hecking remember what I even mapped everything to the very next day.I was a fool. I'm never getting a normal mouse ever again.Pros- I'm a big boy so the total 0.04lbs(19.5g) the weights add don't really help all that much but it has given me an idea to jerryrig it with some heavier metals. Very good idea overall. Makes you shooty real good.- I love multiple dpi levels so having FIVE different ones is amazing. Sometimes a game thinks 800 DPI means you should whip across the screen just by breathing but with this instead of fumbling in the settings for twenty minutes I can just lower my DPI.- As edgy and somewhat confusing as the program is for this mouse, it's very very helpful and can even bind macros and use the F13-F24 keys.- The gratuitous amount of buttons are wonderful, if there's any extra amount of nonsense an MMO tries demanding I press, I just bind those to the side of the mouse. I missed my back and forward buttons but I just bound those to 1 and 4 and problem solved.- There are multiple profiles that you can even swap to with one of the macros for those of course that play many many games and wish to have a profile for each game or each class yadda yadda.- It is 100% fully customizable, even the mouse buttons can be changed. You can rebind left click, you can rebind right click, middle click, scroll wheel, and if you don't swap between DPI at all you can even rebind the dpi buttons to do something else.- It's got gamer stickers for your PC tower or whatever if you're a weirdo who needs those.- This thing comes in an adorable little carepackage case lookin' thing. Even the weights have a tiny case.- RGB go brr. (Very customizable for any setup.)Cons- Nothing tells you where to download the fricken fracken software. I just googled red dragon software (which is not what this is) then proceeded to google \"redragon\" software and found it that way.- The program for this mouse as mentioned before is somewhat confusing.- This could entirely be because I am stupid but I thought auto-fire meant rapid fire. At first it didn't seem to fire or automatically do so either. Upon further testing it does more of a burst fire sorta thing. I thought I was supposed to just hold it down and it'd rapid fire but I guess not. This can be adjusted to fire more than a few times and adjust the \"delay\" but setting the delay to 0 doesn't do squat.- Maybe my hands are just a bit big but this ergonomic mouse doesn't feel very ergonomic. I've since just put my hand on it at an angle and it feels better but I can tell that's not the way it was designed."}

I bought it to replace my old, wired Redragon MMO mouse. The old mouse in question is still fully functional, and the only reason it was replaced was because I wanted something newer (in terms of appearance), and wireless.The fact the my older Redragon mouse lasted so long (over 8 years, and still going) is what compelled me to seek out Redragon yet again for a new mouse. The other deciding factor were the side buttons. Many other MMO mice that I've used, whilst having great ergonomics, all seem to have the same issue: the buttons are WAY too sensitive. With the M913, I do not have this issue. The side buttons on the M913 are just the right amount of rigid where I don't accidentally press them in the heat of the moment (I'm an anxious wreck and tend to clamp my hand during stressful scenarios).I'll keep it brief with the Pros and Cons:PROS:- Build Quality- Battery Life- Aesthetics- RGB- Wireless- PriceCONS:- Software (Not the worst, but far from the best)- Gloss Finish (the side grips are absolute fingerprint magnets)I've decided to give a full five-star rating, as the pros far outweigh the cons and there is nothing about this mouse that I find lacking in terms of functionality."}

I use the mouse for gaming/office, but I'm no pro gamer.The sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.  Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Button click quality is similar.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Switched from Logitech G604 (3 years) to Redragon M908 (2 months)DIFFERENCESRedragon is wired.  Changing batteries is annoying, but rarely needed.  For me the wire is fine on the desk, but on-the-go users will like the Logitech better.Logitech also has a sensor/bluetooth switch, allowing for use on two different computers.  Redragon is plug-and-play on one computer at a time, but does a better job at on-boarding macros.Logitech has the fly-wheel scrolling.  As nice as it is, it's not really noticable when you don't have the option.  Unless you access a huge table to scroll through...  Logitech also has left/right switches on the wheel, which I found annoying.Logitech has major double click issues.  Tried on two mice and changed the switch, still problems.  Those started about 9-12 months into using the mouse, so too early to compare to Redragon but it turned me off Logitech.SIMILARITIESThe sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.

Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Button click quality feels the same.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.CONCLUSIONLogitech's only true strength was the 2-computer wireless feature.  But that alone doesn't justify the very high price compared to the Redragon.  If the Redragon doesn't suffer the same double-click issues after a year, then I'll easily prefer the wired solution than the double-click frustrations.  Time will tell though.  I'll vote 5*, easily will buy Redragon again after this, no more Logitech."}

I was using a razer naga for a while, but it ended up losing functionality in some of the buttons on the side.  So I got this thing and will not be going back to Razer.  It is far cheaper and better made.  I don't understand the weights inside of it, but some people are weird about their gaming things, so I guess its good to have the ability to customize the weight?If you are a gamer with limited mobility in your hands, short fingers, or have arthritis, I highly recommend a mouse like this one.  It makes gaming fun rather than painful and frustrating.  It takes time to get used to, but put in the effort to learn and it is FAR better on your hands than standard keybinds on a keyboard."}

I've had 2 of them for a year. One at work and one on my gaming laptop. The 12 button number pad is super useful. I wish I could figure out how to use a few of them as a kind of short script clipboard without having to set up macros, the macros take forever to fine tune out the extra typing time. I do use a clipboard app for scripts and stuff, but there are a few I'd like to have at a single button push. At first I thought the battery life was bad, because they would only last a few days between charges, but I realized the lights use a ton of battery and I really don't care about them most of the time. In Eco mode, this mouse lasts a month or two between charges, maybe more I don't really keep track but definitely more than a month of 8-hour-a-day use."}

They're very useful for playing action games that have hotkeys that may be difficult to press using the keyboard, as well as web browsing since you can program them to function as page down, page up, alt+back, etc. One disappointing thing with this model is that the DPI adjustment buttons cannot be reprogrammed. I had an old mouse from Redragon where these buttons were reprogrammable and I found it very useful to have them function as home and end keys. This is impossible with this mouse.I saw other reviews saying that the software was comparable with Linux, this is not the case.

I'm never getting a normal mouse ever again.Pros- I'm a big boy so the total 0.04lbs(19.5g) the weights add don't really help all that much but it has given me an idea to jerryrig it with some heavier metals. Very good idea overall. Makes you shooty real good.- I love multiple dpi levels so having FIVE different ones is amazing. Sometimes a game thinks 800 DPI means you should whip across the screen just by breathing but with this instead of fumbling in the settings for twenty minutes I can just lower my DPI.- As edgy and somewhat confusing as the program is for this mouse, it's very very helpful and can even bind macros and use the F13-F24 keys.- The gratuitous amount of buttons are wonderful, if there's any extra amount of nonsense an MMO tries demanding I press, I just bind those to the side of the mouse. I missed my back and forward buttons but I just bound those to 1 and 4 and problem solved.- There are multiple profiles that you can even swap to with one of the macros for those of course that play many many games and wish to have a profile for each game or each class yadda yadda.- It is 100% fully customizable, even the mouse buttons can be changed. You can rebind left click, you can rebind right click, middle click, scroll wheel, and if you don't swap between DPI at all you can even rebind the dpi buttons to do something else.- It's got gamer stickers for your PC tower or whatever if you're a weirdo who needs those.- This thing comes in an adorable little carepackage case lookin' thing. Even the weights have a tiny case.- RGB go brr. (Very customizable for any setup.)Cons- Nothing tells you where to download the fricken fracken software. I just googled red dragon software (which is not what this is) then proceeded to google \"redragon\" software and found it that way.- The program for this mouse as mentioned before is somewhat confusing.- This could entirely be because I am stupid but I thought auto-fire meant rapid fire. At first it didn't seem to fire or automatically do so either. Upon further testing it does more of a burst fire sorta thing. I thought I was supposed to just hold it down and it'd rapid fire but I guess not. This can be adjusted to fire more than a few times and adjust the \"delay\" but setting the delay to 0 doesn't do squat.- Maybe my hands are just a bit big but this ergonomic mouse doesn't feel very ergonomic. I've since just put my hand on it at an angle and it feels better but I can tell that's not the way it was designed."}

I bought it to replace my old, wired Redragon MMO mouse. The old mouse in question is still fully functional, and the only reason it was replaced was because I wanted something newer (in terms of appearance), and wireless.The fact the my older Redragon mouse lasted so long (over 8 years, and still going) is what compelled me to seek out Redragon yet again for a new mouse. The other deciding factor were the side buttons. Many other MMO mice that I've used, whilst having great ergonomics, all seem to have the same issue: the buttons are WAY too sensitive. With the M913, I do not have this issue. The side buttons on the M913 are just the right amount of rigid where I don't accidentally press them in the heat of the moment (I'm an anxious wreck and tend to clamp my hand during stressful scenarios).I'll keep it brief with the Pros and Cons:PROS:- Build Quality- Battery Life- Aesthetics- RGB- Wireless- PriceCONS:- Software (Not the worst, but far from the best)- Gloss Finish (the side grips are absolute fingerprint magnets)I've decided to give a full five-star rating, as the pros far outweigh the cons and there is nothing about this mouse that I find lacking in terms of functionality."}

I use the mouse for gaming/office, but I'm no pro gamer.The sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.  Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Button click quality is similar.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Switched from Logitech G604 (3 years) to Redragon M908 (2 months)DIFFERENCESRedragon is wired.  Changing batteries is annoying, but rarely needed.  For me the wire is fine on the desk, but on-the-go users will like the Logitech better.Logitech also has a sensor/bluetooth switch, allowing for use on two different computers.  Redragon is plug-and-play on one computer at a time, but does a better job at on-boarding macros.Logitech has the fly-wheel scrolling.  As nice as it is, it's not really noticable when you don't have the option.  Unless you access a huge table to scroll through...  Logitech also has left/right switches on the wheel, which I found annoying.Logitech has major double click issues.  Tried on two mice and changed the switch, still problems.  Those started about 9-12 months into using the mouse, so too early to compare to Redragon but it turned me off Logitech.SIMILARITIESThe sensors feel about equal.  Logitech is supposed to be much better but I don't notice a difference.  Both mice have an easy to use dpi switch.Redragon is slightly shorter in length which I prefer, otherwise similar size.  Logitech has the better body material, but it gets dirty so quick that I actual prefer the more plastic look of Redragon.  Redragon has LED.  Logitech with the battery is heavier than the Redragon with all the weights, but it's a similar feeling on the desk.Button click quality feels the same.  Button layout is different but both are easy to get used to.CONCLUSIONLogitech's only true strength was the 2-computer wireless feature.  But that alone doesn't justify the very high price compared to the Redragon.  If the Redragon doesn't suffer the same double-click issues after a year, then I'll easily prefer the wired solution than the double-click frustrations.  Time will tell though.  I'll vote 5*, easily will buy Redragon again after this, no more Logitech."}

I was using a razer naga for a while, but it ended up losing functionality in some of the buttons on the side.  So I got this thing and will not be going back to Razer.  It is far cheaper and better made.  I don't understand the weights inside of it, but some people are weird about their gaming things, so I guess its good to have the ability to customize the weight?If you are a gamer with limited mobility in your hands, short fingers, or have arthritis, I highly recommend a mouse like this one.  It makes gaming fun rather than painful and frustrating.  It takes time to get used to, but put in the effort to learn and it is FAR better on your hands than standard keybinds on a keyboard."}

I've had 2 of them for a year. One at work and one on my gaming laptop. The 12 button number pad is super useful. I wish I could figure out how to use a few of them as a kind of short script clipboard without having to set up macros, the macros take forever to fine tune out the extra typing time. I do use a clipboard app for scripts and stuff, but there are a few I'd like to have at a single button push. At first I thought the battery life was bad, because they would only last a few days between charges, but I realized the lights use a ton of battery and I really don't care about them most of the time. In Eco mode, this mouse lasts a month or two between charges, maybe more I don't really keep track but definitely more than a month of 8-hour-a-day use."}

They're very useful for playing action games that have hotkeys that may be difficult to press using the keyboard, as well as web browsing since you can program them to function as page down, page up, alt+back, etc. One disappointing thing with this model is that the DPI adjustment buttons cannot be reprogrammed. I had an old mouse from Redragon where these buttons were reprogrammable and I found it very useful to have them function as home and end keys. This is impossible with this mouse.I saw other reviews saying that the software was comparable with Linux, this is not the case. Using both Wine and a virtual machine caused the software to fail to recognize the mouse. Luckily I had an old Windows 7 laptop I could use and the mouse remembers its programming across computers, but if you don't have access to a Windows machine at all you'd be out of luck."}

Great customer service, and the mouse itself is very comfortable for medium to large hands.  (Very large hands may find it a bit small though).Note - you will need to download their software if you want to re-bind the mouse buttons.  The top 2 buttons near the scroll wheel are default set to change mouse sensitivity.  This is great if you play multiple games with different sensitivity preferences, but otherwise it's just a pain because you'll accidentally change the sensitivity a lot.

You can just eat an apple with your left hand (or anything else you do with your left hand) while you do all sorts of typical crap.  I set the SIXTEEN extra buttons to: close window, cut, copy, paste, show desktop, alt-tab, back, forward, window maximize & minimize, delete, save, ctrl-home, windows-tab, and ctrl-w.  (You can choose your own stuff or key combinations like ctrl+alt+Q) I don't mean you must CHOOSE two or three from the above.  You can have the mouse set to ALL of these at the same time, so that you can click ANY of them with just your mouse.Two downsides:1) It takes a bit of FINESSE to learn how to hit all the side buttons exactly, however, they're also as ergonomically intuitive as possible, like some are angled a little backwards or forwards, or are dented, so your thumb can get a sense of which button it's brushing.  This is NOT for your grandma (who might accidentally delete your C drive if she's fumbling with it), nor is it for a clumsy bodybuilder who's used to gripping the whole mouse very tightly and can barely hit the left or right buttons.  So consider if anyone like this might use your mouse!2) I find the software a bit picky sometimes.  There IS always a way to do what you want to do, but sometimes you have to like hit \"apply\" before \"ok\" or something dumb like that.  I give it a B- to B+.  But once you get everything down, it's great.I'd guess that my praise probably would go for most of this company's other mouse versions, too.

I set the SIXTEEN extra buttons to: close window, cut, copy, paste, show desktop, alt-tab, back, forward, window maximize & minimize, delete, save, ctrl-home, windows-tab, and ctrl-w.  (You can choose your own stuff or key combinations like ctrl+alt+Q) I don't mean you must CHOOSE two or three from the above.  You can have the mouse set to ALL of these at the same time, so that you can click ANY of them with just your mouse.Two downsides:1) It takes a bit of FINESSE to learn how to hit all the side buttons exactly, however, they're also as ergonomically intuitive as possible, like some are angled a little backwards or forwards, or are dented, so your thumb can get a sense of which button it's brushing.  This is NOT for your grandma (who might accidentally delete your C drive if she's fumbling with it), nor is it for a clumsy bodybuilder who's used to gripping the whole mouse very tightly and can barely hit the left or right buttons.  So consider if anyone like this might use your mouse!2) I find the software a bit picky sometimes.  There IS always a way to do what you want to do, but sometimes you have to like hit \"apply\" before \"ok\" or something dumb like that.  I give it a B- to B+.  But once you get everything down, it's great.I'd guess that my praise probably would go for most of this company's other mouse versions, too.  I look at them online and they seem pretty similar, so maybe also consider another model..."}

Glad to see this becoming universal! - I don't need all the side buttons, but they are kind of nice.Cons: - No Bluetooth?  What year is this, 2012?? - The software to set the buttons kinda sucks.  And it's really hard to find on the website.  You have to do Ctrl+F \"M913\" or you'll download the wrong one and not know why it's not working. - On a mouse of this price range, it would be nice to have a thumb scroll wheel for left-right scrolling. - Battery doesn't last very long if you have it on RGB mode."}

I would recommend it for people who are looking for a mouse that not only does exactly what it’s supposed to, but a little more, too! One thing I noticed, though: don’t leave your mouse on all the time! Sleep mode drains the battery too. I put a new battery into my last mouse and tried to put it in my new one, but the battery was dead. So, now I’m careful to turn off my mouse if I’m not going to be using it for a while. But really, that’s something we should all be doing with all devices, so that’s not much of a problem. Great mouse!I needed a mouse for work, a simple one that works without a mousepad. This worked really well and was very responsive. I think other reviewers did a better job of going over its DPI and DPI settings, but since I didn’t have any gaming to do (used to; not so much), I didn’t really need all those settings. They were nice to have, however. I found that the sleep mode could be a little laggy, which wasn’t ideal… I’d have to click to wake it up rather than shake the mouse, which made it so I’d inadvertently click something like the “x” on a browser window. Modern technology makes it so I don’t have to worry about that much (Google Chrome can easily restore my last session), but it’s still a bother to click things I didn’t mean to click and throw me off for a minute or two. The thing that bothered me the most was that there were times my mouse simply would not work coming back from sleep mode, and I’d have to do some kind of troubleshooting — such as shutting off the mouse, unplugging its USB, waiting a moment, then plugging the USB back in, then turning on the mouse again…then repeat if it didn’t work the first time — to get it back up and running again. I was in the midst of troubleshooting my mouse’s connectivity issues (which didn’t resolve no matter what USB drive I put the receiver into) when I got distracted, and now, I can’t find the receiver. I don’t know if I got a faulty mouse in some way (everything BUT the receiver and sleep mode worked great & without fail), but since I’ve lost the receiver… I don’t think I’ll be buying again.

{"asin": "B08QVNG4BM", "username": "Eric Peterson", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nNaga Pro brings positives of Naga Trinity to a wireless mode", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020", "purchased": "Size: MouseStyle: Naga Pro", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "TL;DR - I've been waiting for a new wireless version of the Naga for some time now. As a multi-genre gamer that mainly plays MMOs but occasionally dabbles in other genres like shooters, the Trinity concept is perfect. The Naga Pro feels like slightly upgraded and wireless available version of an already great mouse. If you're a fan of the original Naga Trinity or looking for a great all-around wireless gaming mouse with a large number of buttons, the Naga Pro comes as a strong recommendation.Longer version: I've always liked the general feel of the Naga mouse - not too big, not too small, relatively ergonomic to my average if not slightly smaller hand size for a guy. I've been using the mouse and its different versions since the OG back in 2009, and my favorite version was the 2014 Epic Chroma that also had a wireless option. Since then, Naga mice haven't supported wireless. That's unfortunate as I like the clean desk look of a wireless mouse, and get annoyed by the \"tug\" of the cable despite trying some gadgets that try to wrangle cables in the ideal positions. The downside for wireless, purportedly, is the delay versus wired mouse. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference. It feels instantaneous to me. Wired vs Wireless is only something that matters to professional gamers, when every tiny detail gives an edge over the competition. But for 99% of gamers out there, your skill is going to define your performance/ranking far more than something like a minuscule amount of delay on your mouse. Suffice to say, it's not going to turn your game around enough to choose wired over wireless if you generally prefer wireless. Razer touts its \"Hyperspeed\" wireless - I don't know how much of that is just marketing nonsense. To my feeling, the responsiveness at least compares to my Logitech G305, which I use for my setup in my living room with my nVIDIA Shield.Now I'll ramble a bit about Naga as a product line. I've gone through like 6 different Naga mouse over the years - none of them broke; they've all performed great. I only upgraded them because of wanting features, or because they  were getting too grimy after many hours of use (which as an MMO gamer, they have gotten many hundreds of hours of mileage). Firstly, if you're generally in the market for a MMO mouse and looking at the different options out there, I think the Naga has always been the best. I've tried some of the others out there from Corsair and Logitech. They're decent products, but ultimately the thing that has me coming back is the physical ergonomics of the Naga. I love the shape of the mouse, and the 12 buttons are easy to differentiate from each other by the individual button contours. It doesn't even need \"bumps\" to help you train your muscle memory (which would eventually erode over time, trust me). The only downside is that I feel like the last three buttons (10, 11, and 12) are difficult to hit without hand strain, but this may be because of my smaller sized hand and getting older.That being said, 1 through 9 is still some great button real estate. As far as playing MMOs, I consider the Naga (or a similar mouse) essential. I honestly don't know how I used to play without them. You can use them as additional button binds, or you can replicate your number keys to give your hands some different options to hit the same keys (which I do to overcome hand strain from long hours of play). If you've never tried a mouse like this and aren't sure if it's worth it  - it is. The only challenge is the initial learning curve. It took me several weeks to really get used to using the mouse, but once I did, there was no going back. It helps so much in raiding, for example, when you might need to be running around with WASD while also hitting a complex button rotation. Doing this is night and day between having a Naga and not having a Naga.Now, I'll zero in on the Naga Pro. This only just came out, so I can't review it for things like battery longevity. That being said, Razer's not new to the PC product game, so I have nor reason to doubt in its technical specifications for the charge time. Out of the box, the mouse does feel very similar to the Trinity, if not exactly the same. The shape is the same, the side button contours are the same, and the materials seem the same. The materials I think are perhaps the only slight downfall of the product - it has a bit of a plasticy feel to it; I wish the product felt more solid. That being said, the light weight does help in situations like FPS gaming, when you need to move the mouse quickly. For a chunkier sized mouse, it's not a bad weight. But if you solely game FPS, the Naga would be hard to recommend. There are lighter mice out there, and you might want to consider something wired. That being said, if you are just a casual FPS gamer, or playing something like Borderlands, the Naga works just fine, if not outstanding with the additional button potential. The hot-swappable left panel is one of the coolest innovations in gaming mice tech I've seen in years. It works instantly and without a hitch. It snaps in place magnetically - it feels solid and never like it's a weird attachment.Speaking about the additional buttons, that's another thing that's changed over the Trinity. The hot-swappable left panel has gotten rid of one panel in exchange for another. Instead of the \"circular\" button layout designed for MOBAs (which tbh I never used, even as someone who occasionally plays MOBAs), there is a more condensed 1-6 button layout. It's kind of a nice option for people who play MMOs with fewer keybinds like Guild Wars 2, or someone who can't reach all 12 buttons. I see this as an improvement over the Trinity, as I never used the circular button layout and could potentially use the 1-6 grid layout.Long story short (too late), so far, I think the Naga Pro is great. It maintains the greatness of the Trinity product and brings in to a wireless version. If you liked the Trinity, you will like the Naga Pro. If you did not like the Trinity, you will not like the Naga Pro. If you're new in the market for a MMO mouse, I recommend trying it out. Be gentle with it though and leave yourself the option to return if you don't like it. Some people complain about the scroll wheel, but I've never had an issue there. Suffice to say, mice are personal and subjective peripherals, and things like shape and ergonomics differ in preference from person to person. This might not be the mouse for you. But as a concept, it's executed well and one of the best on market. The final downside is the price - it's on the expensive side. But for me, input is how you interact with your game - it's the connection between you and what's happening in-game. It's worth investing in as a core part of your setup."}

As a passionate gamer, this mouse has taken my gameplay to a whole new level of control, versatility, and precision.First and foremost, I have to mention the wireless functionality of the Naga Pro. It’s absolutely seamless and reliable. The 2.4GHz HyperSpeed wireless technology ensures a super-fast and lag-free connection, giving me the freedom to move around without any restrictions. I’m impressed with how responsive it is; it feels just as good as using a wired gaming mouse. With no worries about input delay, it creates an immersive and enjoyable gaming environment.One of the standout features of the Naga Pro is its modular design. I love how the side plates are interchangeable, allowing me to customize the mouse to match different game genres and playstyles. Whether I’m playing an MMO and need the classic 12-button layout, diving into a MOBA with a 6-button configuration, or engaging in FPS games with a clean and minimalistic layout, this mouse has got me covered. The magnetic attachment system is a breeze to use, and it keeps the side plates securely in place during intense gaming sessions.Speaking of buttons, the Naga Pro has mechanical switches that feel amazing to click. They’re tactile, responsive, and consistent. Each click provides a satisfying feedback that adds to the overall gaming experience. The button placement is well-thought-out and easily accessible, enabling quick and seamless execution of complex commands. It’s also worth mentioning that the ability to assign macros and remap buttons using Razer Synapse software adds an extra layer of customization, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs.The Naga Pro’s 20,000 DPI Focus+ optical sensor is a beast in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. It offers flawless tracking, even during the most intense and fast-paced gaming moments. Being able to customize the DPI settings allows me to fine-tune the mouse’s sensitivity to match my preferences perfectly. This ensures precise aiming and pixel-perfect accuracy, which is a significant advantage, especially in competitive gaming.Comfort is key during long gaming sessions, and the Naga Pro delivers in that department. The ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly, providing a comfortable and natural grip. The mouse glides smoothly across different surfaces, thanks to its PTFE feet, reducing fatigue and giving me better control. The build quality is exceptional, too, with a sturdy construction that feels durable and reliable.Last but not least, let’s talk about battery life. The Naga Pro impresses with its long-lasting battery. I can enjoy up to 150 hours of uninterrupted gaming on a single charge, which means I rarely have to reach for the charging cable. Plus, the included charging dock makes it incredibly convenient to keep the mouse charged when I’m not using it. The fact that I can continue gaming while it’s charging is a testament to the versatility and convenience of this fantastic gaming mouse.In conclusion, the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is an absolute must-have for gamers who are serious about their gameplay. Its wireless capabilities, modular design, precise tracking, and ergonomic feel make it a powerhouse in the gaming world. With the Naga Pro, you can unleash your gaming potential and elevate your gameplay to new heights!Disclaimer: I received no compensation or incentives for writing this review. I genuinely believe in the quality and performance of the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse."}

My mind has been COMPLETELY changed! even being on the low end price wise for a good mouse this thing packs a punch. It's got a nice braided cable that doesn't look like it's going to wear out in a few months. its got a finger rest on the side which is GREAT for someone like me with larger hands. without the rest my ring and pinkie fingers would always get fatigued just dragging beside the mouse but no more! It's also got the simple to use keypad to use with your thumb on the side which has not only made gaming easier, it has also upped productivity when doing other work as you can program all 12 buttons to do different things all to your liking. Lastly you've got the chroma lighting that can also be VASTLY customized. best part is that it mostly plug and play but you will be asked to install Razer software which isn't a problem because it's needed to customize the mouse. Overall this has been the best mouse I have used in my experience with computers over the years."}

Really enjoy the lighting customization with a Razor keyboard as well as the ability to customize the adjustable DPI on the mouse.Only issue myself and others have consistently ran into is that every once in a while the mouse will either fail to recognize the side button presses or will fail to recognize the side completely. In the early stages of this disease you can remove the panel and put it back on, clean the pins, or push the panel into the mouse, but once it progresses enough you either have to get a new mouse or send it into Razor to have it fixed / replaced.

Then it works like a charm and is super easy. As far as size, I have pretty small hands and it's not too bad. It's a tiny bit of a stretch for my thumb to reach the top three numbers.

Finally, I landed on the Naga Pro, and I've been extensively using this mouse for around a month. If you are a gamer, a video editor, or you like to play around in any program and need more shortcuts, this mouse will change your life.I've tested single-handed computer operation in games and adobe creative suite using this mouse, and it can help people tremendously. If you get an injury, you don't have to stop gaming. Just bind some of those keys onto the mouse and keep going. For example, I spent the majority of my time playing Diablo 4 using only this mouse.Pros:-Up to 19 programmable buttons-Battery Life lasts ~1 1/2 days (considerable use)-Configurable Plates for different button preferences-Glides much nicer than expected, and its feet seem higher quality than my old Naga-Chroma (lights)-Left & Right click on the scroll wheel have been a gamer changer for me-Option to use Bluetooth, wired mode, or the included dongle. Switching between the three is easy too.-Often on sale and not too different from the Naga Pro 2, but much cheaper-Uses Synapse 3, so it will be supported for quite a while Cons:-Side buttons are very sensitive (this could also be a pro, depending on the user)-The left and right clicks are somewhat heavy and seem to take a bit more effort to push down-Louder clicks than some options out there-Still not the cheapest option out there"}

The Naga is my favorite because of its shape. I have rather large hands and long fingers, and the way this mouse sits in my palm is pretty much perfect. Very ergonomic and solid grip. Sure, DeathAdder as well as Mamba are also very comfortable, but there's something special about having this heavy & big mouse, with the arching bulge, under my palm. I feel very much in control of its movement and, actually, appreciate its weight. It's precise and customizable enough for my needs. The three RGB zones may be lacking to some, but, really, it all comes down to how comfortable a mouse feels and not how it looks.I like its clicky somewhat stiffer buttons. The main buttons take a bit of effort to actuate than the buttons on DeathAdder or Mamba but I like that feeling. There are less accidental miss-clicks. Perhaps a professional CS:GO player would appreciate the light weight and sensitivity of DeathAdder, but I, just a casual gamer that plays a lot of story-driven FPS and RPGs, really dig the Naga. Sure, the sensor it has can't be as fine-tuned with the software as the one in the DeathAdder, but this aspect has 0 difference to me personally.  And don't get me wrong, the sensor it has is very good, probably the same hardware, in fact, that goes up to 16000 DPI -- it just can't be as minutely adjusted by software as on some of other Razer mice. I use stock presets. Low sensitivity for FPS, higher sensitivity for RTS, etc. The stock sensitivity options are plenty sufficient to me but can be modified to some extent by the Synapse.I am sure a lot of people would seek this mouse not for its shape but for the fact that it has three panels for the left side with various button layouts. I do find that having the extra buttons is nice and I've been learning to utilize them more. It feels awesome having all 12 of my most used spells in WoW being accessible by the thumb. It does take a bit of practice to get good with those buttons but it's really worth it, especially when it comes to PVP. The fact that you don't have to use the panel with 12 buttons if you don't want to, and could have a panel with 7 or 3 -- is very nifty. Certain titles might work better with the lesser number of buttons and switching them on the go is effortless. It really is like having three mice in one. Others noted that the replaceable panels feel very solid and I will note that too. There's no give or any kind of rattling. They sit in secured by magnets the way that you can't even tell that they are replaceable. I think that's certainly a big win for the design.I can't comment on the reliability or how long this mouse would last. I see a lot of negative comments from people that complain of the buttons' failure. I haven't experienced any of this yet, though I haven't used this mouse for a long time. My other two Razer mice -- the DeathAdder Elite and the Mamba Elite -- have no issues. The DeathAdder is nearly 5 years old since I purchased it. It sill runs strong and there's only mild wear, for the most part it still looks like new. Sure, Naga is a very different model than the other two and it may behave differently, but so far Razer got a very good, nearly excellent, track-record with me. Otherwise I wouldn't purchase this mouse in the first place.The three RGB zones may put some people away but to me it doesn't matter. I don't stare at my mouse when I play and the comfort of use is way more important than the pretty lights. The Mamba Elite has some very extensive RGB to it and I have it plugged in for the pretty effects (starlight looks awesome on its sides!), and it's more of a display piece now on my desk than my daily driver. The Naga, on the other hand, has become the daily driver that I very much enjoy using. I wish I bought it as my first Razer mouse, so that by now I would have been a pro with the extra buttons!"}

As a long time WoW player since original TBC, I have used every mouse you can think of. When MMO mouses came out and I made the switch to using them, I have tried them all. I settled on the Naga Trinity which I have been using now for the last few years. Do they last long? Not really. I think I have been through around 4 or 5 Trinitys since I have used them. Either a side button stops working when pressed and doesn't register everytime or the scroll wheel gets really notchy and hard to use which I use alot. My last 2 Trinitys were bad scroll wheels. When playing I use scroll wheel up/down/click with shift modifiers whether it's arena targeting or other class abilities. Also the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel I remap to ALT and Shift so I can hold that button down and use a key on my keyboard for a bind.I decided to try the Naga X this time recommend by a rank 1 glad player and it's nothing but amazing and an improvement over the Trinity IMO. It's noticeably lighter by a lot. Doesn't it feel sort of like cheap plastic? Yes, but I could care less. That's why it is light. I noticed the razer symbol on the back of the mouse doesn't light up like it does on the Trinity. I could care less, hand is covering that part of the mouse anyways. That's probably also why it lighter. Does the X have interchangeable side panels for the amount of buttons you want on the side? No, that's why I'm buying an MMO mouse so that's not important to me. If I wanted a mouse with 2 or 6 buttons than I'd be buying something else. Just a marketing thing in my eyes for the Trinity to give people more options. The PTFE feet seem to glide better and feel smoother. The speed flex cable on the X is amazing compared to the stiff Trinity cable, another plus. I've never been a fan of wireless mice like the Naga Pro for example. I don't ever want to worry about battery life or my mouse to stop working. It's like wireless internet compared to wired. An ethernet connection is much more secure and something less to worry about as with anything wired. A mouse is no different. The side buttons feel the same between the two, nice light click and responsive. The scroll wheel on the X beats the Trinity hands down. The reason is because the Trinity has tilt left/right and the X does not. That tilt left/right causes the scroll wheel to feel loose overtime and with my experience causes the gear in the scroll wheel to get notchy and cause scrolling problems. I never used tilt scroll wheel so it's not important to me. The scroll wheel on the X is solid and smooth as butter. No tilt left/right but nice solid smooth scroll up/down/click. The X only has one big button behind the scroll wheel which I remaped to ALT. For some reason I find hitting that 1 big button easier than the 2 buttons on the Trinity. I can live without a 2nd button, didn't really use it tbh. Can't miss it or fat finger a second button. Not really sure what else to say other than I'd highly recommend giving the X a shot if what I've listed is important to you. Time will tell now how the X holds up compared to the Trinity overtime but the Naga X is my new go to mouse. Going to buy another as a backup because they are on sale and I can buy 2 for the price of 1 Trinity."}

As a multi-genre gamer that mainly plays MMOs but occasionally dabbles in other genres like shooters, the Trinity concept is perfect. The Naga Pro feels like slightly upgraded and wireless available version of an already great mouse. If you're a fan of the original Naga Trinity or looking for a great all-around wireless gaming mouse with a large number of buttons, the Naga Pro comes as a strong recommendation.Longer version: I've always liked the general feel of the Naga mouse - not too big, not too small, relatively ergonomic to my average if not slightly smaller hand size for a guy. I've been using the mouse and its different versions since the OG back in 2009, and my favorite version was the 2014 Epic Chroma that also had a wireless option. Since then, Naga mice haven't supported wireless. That's unfortunate as I like the clean desk look of a wireless mouse, and get annoyed by the \"tug\" of the cable despite trying some gadgets that try to wrangle cables in the ideal positions. The downside for wireless, purportedly, is the delay versus wired mouse. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference. It feels instantaneous to me. Wired vs Wireless is only something that matters to professional gamers, when every tiny detail gives an edge over the competition. But for 99% of gamers out there, your skill is going to define your performance/ranking far more than something like a minuscule amount of delay on your mouse. Suffice to say, it's not going to turn your game around enough to choose wired over wireless if you generally prefer wireless. Razer touts its \"Hyperspeed\" wireless - I don't know how much of that is just marketing nonsense. To my feeling, the responsiveness at least compares to my Logitech G305, which I use for my setup in my living room with my nVIDIA Shield.Now I'll ramble a bit about Naga as a product line.

I love the shape of the mouse, and the 12 buttons are easy to differentiate from each other by the individual button contours. It doesn't even need \"bumps\" to help you train your muscle memory (which would eventually erode over time, trust me). The only downside is that I feel like the last three buttons (10, 11, and 12) are difficult to hit without hand strain, but this may be because of my smaller sized hand and getting older.That being said, 1 through 9 is still some great button real estate.

Being able to customize the DPI settings allows me to fine-tune the mouse’s sensitivity to match my preferences perfectly. This ensures precise aiming and pixel-perfect accuracy, which is a significant advantage, especially in competitive gaming.Comfort is key during long gaming sessions, and the Naga Pro delivers in that department. The ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly, providing a comfortable and natural grip. The mouse glides smoothly across different surfaces, thanks to its PTFE feet, reducing fatigue and giving me better control. The build quality is exceptional, too, with a sturdy construction that feels durable and reliable.Last but not least, let’s talk about battery life. The Naga Pro impresses with its long-lasting battery. I can enjoy up to 150 hours of uninterrupted gaming on a single charge, which means I rarely have to reach for the charging cable. Plus, the included charging dock makes it incredibly convenient to keep the mouse charged when I’m not using it. The fact that I can continue gaming while it’s charging is a testament to the versatility and convenience of this fantastic gaming mouse.In conclusion, the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is an absolute must-have for gamers who are serious about their gameplay. Its wireless capabilities, modular design, precise tracking, and ergonomic feel make it a powerhouse in the gaming world. With the Naga Pro, you can unleash your gaming potential and elevate your gameplay to new heights!Disclaimer: I received no compensation or incentives for writing this review. I genuinely believe in the quality and performance of the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse."}

My mind has been COMPLETELY changed! even being on the low end price wise for a good mouse this thing packs a punch. It's got a nice braided cable that doesn't look like it's going to wear out in a few months. its got a finger rest on the side which is GREAT for someone like me with larger hands. without the rest my ring and pinkie fingers would always get fatigued just dragging beside the mouse but no more! It's also got the simple to use keypad to use with your thumb on the side which has not only made gaming easier, it has also upped productivity when doing other work as you can program all 12 buttons to do different things all to your liking. Lastly you've got the chroma lighting that can also be VASTLY customized. best part is that it mostly plug and play but you will be asked to install Razer software which isn't a problem because it's needed to customize the mouse. Overall this has been the best mouse I have used in my experience with computers over the years."}

Really enjoy the lighting customization with a Razor keyboard as well as the ability to customize the adjustable DPI on the mouse.Only issue myself and others have consistently ran into is that every once in a while the mouse will either fail to recognize the side button presses or will fail to recognize the side completely. In the early stages of this disease you can remove the panel and put it back on, clean the pins, or push the panel into the mouse, but once it progresses enough you either have to get a new mouse or send it into Razor to have it fixed / replaced.

The Naga is my favorite because of its shape. I have rather large hands and long fingers, and the way this mouse sits in my palm is pretty much perfect. Very ergonomic and solid grip. Sure, DeathAdder as well as Mamba are also very comfortable, but there's something special about having this heavy & big mouse, with the arching bulge, under my palm. I feel very much in control of its movement and, actually, appreciate its weight. It's precise and customizable enough for my needs. The three RGB zones may be lacking to some, but, really, it all comes down to how comfortable a mouse feels and not how it looks.I like its clicky somewhat stiffer buttons. The main buttons take a bit of effort to actuate than the buttons on DeathAdder or Mamba but I like that feeling. There are less accidental miss-clicks. Perhaps a professional CS:GO player would appreciate the light weight and sensitivity of DeathAdder, but I, just a casual gamer that plays a lot of story-driven FPS and RPGs, really dig the Naga. Sure, the sensor it has can't be as fine-tuned with the software as the one in the DeathAdder, but this aspect has 0 difference to me personally.  And don't get me wrong, the sensor it has is very good, probably the same hardware, in fact, that goes up to 16000 DPI -- it just can't be as minutely adjusted by software as on some of other Razer mice. I use stock presets. Low sensitivity for FPS, higher sensitivity for RTS, etc. The stock sensitivity options are plenty sufficient to me but can be modified to some extent by the Synapse.I am sure a lot of people would seek this mouse not for its shape but for the fact that it has three panels for the left side with various button layouts. I do find that having the extra buttons is nice and I've been learning to utilize them more. It feels awesome having all 12 of my most used spells in WoW being accessible by the thumb. It does take a bit of practice to get good with those buttons but it's really worth it, especially when it comes to PVP. The fact that you don't have to use the panel with 12 buttons if you don't want to, and could have a panel with 7 or 3 -- is very nifty. Certain titles might work better with the lesser number of buttons and switching them on the go is effortless. It really is like having three mice in one. Others noted that the replaceable panels feel very solid and I will note that too. There's no give or any kind of rattling. They sit in secured by magnets the way that you can't even tell that they are replaceable. I think that's certainly a big win for the design.I can't comment on the reliability or how long this mouse would last. I see a lot of negative comments from people that complain of the buttons' failure. I haven't experienced any of this yet, though I haven't used this mouse for a long time. My other two Razer mice -- the DeathAdder Elite and the Mamba Elite -- have no issues. The DeathAdder is nearly 5 years old since I purchased it. It sill runs strong and there's only mild wear, for the most part it still looks like new. Sure, Naga is a very different model than the other two and it may behave differently, but so far Razer got a very good, nearly excellent, track-record with me. Otherwise I wouldn't purchase this mouse in the first place.The three RGB zones may put some people away but to me it doesn't matter. I don't stare at my mouse when I play and the comfort of use is way more important than the pretty lights. The Mamba Elite has some very extensive RGB to it and I have it plugged in for the pretty effects (starlight looks awesome on its sides!), and it's more of a display piece now on my desk than my daily driver. The Naga, on the other hand, has become the daily driver that I very much enjoy using. I wish I bought it as my first Razer mouse, so that by now I would have been a pro with the extra buttons!"}

As a long time WoW player since original TBC, I have used every mouse you can think of. When MMO mouses came out and I made the switch to using them, I have tried them all. I settled on the Naga Trinity which I have been using now for the last few years. Do they last long? Not really. I think I have been through around 4 or 5 Trinitys since I have used them. Either a side button stops working when pressed and doesn't register everytime or the scroll wheel gets really notchy and hard to use which I use alot. My last 2 Trinitys were bad scroll wheels. When playing I use scroll wheel up/down/click with shift modifiers whether it's arena targeting or other class abilities. Also the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel I remap to ALT and Shift so I can hold that button down and use a key on my keyboard for a bind.I decided to try the Naga X this time recommend by a rank 1 glad player and it's nothing but amazing and an improvement over the Trinity IMO. It's noticeably lighter by a lot. Doesn't it feel sort of like cheap plastic? Yes, but I could care less. That's why it is light. I noticed the razer symbol on the back of the mouse doesn't light up like it does on the Trinity. I could care less, hand is covering that part of the mouse anyways. That's probably also why it lighter. Does the X have interchangeable side panels for the amount of buttons you want on the side? No, that's why I'm buying an MMO mouse so that's not important to me. If I wanted a mouse with 2 or 6 buttons than I'd be buying something else. Just a marketing thing in my eyes for the Trinity to give people more options. The PTFE feet seem to glide better and feel smoother. The speed flex cable on the X is amazing compared to the stiff Trinity cable, another plus. I've never been a fan of wireless mice like the Naga Pro for example. I don't ever want to worry about battery life or my mouse to stop working. It's like wireless internet compared to wired. An ethernet connection is much more secure and something less to worry about as with anything wired. A mouse is no different. The side buttons feel the same between the two, nice light click and responsive. The scroll wheel on the X beats the Trinity hands down. The reason is because the Trinity has tilt left/right and the X does not. That tilt left/right causes the scroll wheel to feel loose overtime and with my experience causes the gear in the scroll wheel to get notchy and cause scrolling problems. I never used tilt scroll wheel so it's not important to me. The scroll wheel on the X is solid and smooth as butter. No tilt left/right but nice solid smooth scroll up/down/click. The X only has one big button behind the scroll wheel which I remaped to ALT. For some reason I find hitting that 1 big button easier than the 2 buttons on the Trinity. I can live without a 2nd button, didn't really use it tbh. Can't miss it or fat finger a second button. Not really sure what else to say other than I'd highly recommend giving the X a shot if what I've listed is important to you. Time will tell now how the X holds up compared to the Trinity overtime but the Naga X is my new go to mouse. Going to buy another as a backup because they are on sale and I can buy 2 for the price of 1 Trinity."}

I'm fastidious about mouse accuracy because I'm an artist. Yes, I use a drawing tablet with a pen, but some things are just better done with a mouse. The best thing about this mouse is it works so reliably, way better than the Anker Wireless I ditched for this one. Even though they mentioned the drag free cord in the description, I've never actually seen one, so I didn't expect much of anything different, but it's really pretty slick, and I expect it will catch on eventually for all mice. As for the buttons, this is my first mouse with that many extra buttons (I bought my first mouse in 1982). Some examples would have been nice in the instruction set up, but it actually was pretty simple to set up, I've set up 6 so far. I'm finding I need to be a little more careful in handling the mouse, because I keep accidentally triggering 2, which I have set up to launch Windows Explorer, but I'm sure that will come with time. I've used Razer products before even though I am NOT a gamer, and known them to be good reliable products although pricey for us non-gamers. I recently purchased a Razer keyboard and was pleasantly surprised that that finally ended my keyboard frustrations, so I thought I'd tackle my mouse frustrations next, looks like this one is a definite keeper! That old cliché \"you get what you pay for\" is definitely true when it comes to Razer mice and keyboards."}

Now I got the Naga Trinity. A quick wiki search tells me there have been nine iterations in the Naga series, not counting the redesigned versions and I must say I have never not liked one of my MMO/MOBA mice from RΛZΞR. And I'm not one of them gamer lifestyle junkies or uber Razer fanboys that goes out and buys everything chroma and wears their clothing or nothing. In fact, I actually own plenty of varying brands across my gaming peripherals including Corsair, Logitech, etc. I just like Razers products when it comes to their M+K options. Mice specifically being reviwed here, because they are quality and I trust them as one of the premier gaming hardware manufacturing companies. There are many of these brands out there for PC to choose from these days but Razer is right at the top IMHO..The mouse:After years of using the original Naga, then Hex v2, and now Naga Trinity I got use to  this style of mouse configuration and how the ergonomics or placement of your hand sits on them. It rests a little differently so you might feel awkward at first but trust me you will get use to it with repitition in no time.I liked to keep my muscle memory the same so when my original Naga wore out I looked for another. I ended up going with Hex v2 because the Naga had been phased out with the emergence of popular MOBA's they redesigned it a little bit. I was reluctant to buy that one because i wanted my 12 buttons in 3x4 pattern not the circular 7 buttons. But I got use to it and it sufficed until the Trinity was released.Once the Trinity came out it gives you the best of all worlds really. You can swap out the side button options to what you prefer or need for any specific game you want to play. Or any program you wanna use your mouse with (non-gaming).Which brings me to my next point in Razer mice. They have top notch lasers in them, very accurate. While the implications for gaming are obvious here just as a everyday mouse for anyone using a PC they are worthy of a purchase. They last a long time. Tons of clicks and scrolls on the scroll wheel before they wear down and need to be replaced. Talking years of usage. And I'm a heavy PC user. Not just for games either. Once you use it awhile the tactile feel of the mouse scroll does go away but everything functions fine still. I actually prefer getting them worn in tbh.Lastly, I'm one of the people who actually has no gripes about their hardware configuration tool Synapse. It works flawlessly for me and wasn't that hard to learn either. The tool offers a lot of customization for what each button on the mouse does what even letting you keybind a custom function like Shift+Q to a single button press if you wanna get complex. Also want to point out that on the bottom of this mouse there is a button that quickly swaps profiles so you can set up a profile for each game you are playing. or some MMO games you play different class/job so you can have a different profile and have the buttons do something else on each. Customizing and keybinding to your hearts desire really. Then of course the Synapse has the DPI options and the superfluous stuff like lighting options which is nice and I get why they include it but not wholly needed.All in all you won't be disappointed by this mouse. No matter if you play MMO's/MOBA's/Shooters/or don't game at all. I almost bought two just because i know when it wears out years down the road I'm just going to want to replace it with another one."}

You buy something like this (as opposed to just a regular old mouse) when you want some extra buttons on your mouse compared to a more basic one and want to have more control over exactly what your mouse does. Although this mouse is plug-n-play, you can (and should) download the software that pairs with it so you can customize it to your needs. This includes changing what the buttons do, changing the lighting (or removing it entirely if you prefer), and changing the sensitivity.Recently I tried two top gaming mice, the Corsair Nightsword and this Razer Naga Trinity. I first got the Naga Trinity and would have stayed with it but I had some double-clicking issues when it first arrived. Sometimes when I tried to click things or select text, it would do an extra click or not click at all, which was quite frustrating. I had no choice but to either replace it or try a different mouse, and I opted for the latter.Before I continue, do note that I have pretty large hands (8.25\" from middle finger tip to the crease on my wrist, 4\" across the widest part of my palm (across the knuckles), and nearly 10\" from my thumb tip to my pinky tip when my hands are open wide as if I were trying to palm a basketball) and I use a fintertip style grip (see pictures) on my mouse — your own hand size and grip style will determine whether each of these mice is a good fit for you.Here is what I like and dislike about each, with points from -3 to +3 next to each point which indicate how much I like or dislike each feature (-3 being very much dislike, +3 being very much like):Corsair Nightsword:A. [+3] it has two additional buttons to click on top (gives more top button options for gaming, the Razer only has extra side buttons)B. [+1] it has more protection for the thumb (although my thumb doesn't really drag on the mousepad without it, it's a nice touch)C. [+1] DPI level can be seen from the side of the mouse (rather than the normal which I feel like is by the center top of the mouse which you can't see when your hand is there), a the mouse changes color when you press it to make the change even more salientD. [+0.5] Aesthetically looks better than the Razer Naga in my opinionE. [-1] Middle mouse wheel requires a bit more force than I would like to click itF. [-3] (Dealbreaker for me) I can only reach 1 of the 3 side thumb buttons with my normal grip, despite the fact that I have large hands. I would need to convert to palm grip which is not really desirable as it's less precise with clicking.Razer Naga Trinity:A. [+3] Changeable side panels allow you to use the button setup you prefer, although I feel like the 12 button grid is a bit excessive and wish there was an option for a 6-button grid.B. [+3] The mouse wheel can be tilted left or right which is handy, they can be configured as extra buttonsC. [-3] The double-clicking / misclicking issue I described above. Strangely, it seems to occur much less now for no reason I can explain, but if it happens even one more time I'm going to have to replace the mouse. Note: My particular mouse might simply be defective, but other reviewers have said this is an issue for them as well so clearly there's some sort of quality control issue.For me, the 12-button side panel is great because the way I naturally use the mouse my thumb rests right in the center of all the buttons, making them all accessible if need-be (though pressing the middle buttons is a bit trickier, at least I can reach all of them whereas my partner with smaller hands cannot easily press all the buttons even if she wanted to).I'll probably stick with the Razer Naga trinity (and re-order a new one if the clicking issues persist) simply because the side buttons are difficult to reach for me with the Corsair Nightsword, but I hope I provided enough detail so you can make a more-informed decision for yourself. :)"}

The magnets are strong enough to keep the panel firmly attached to the mouse (no wiggling at all), but are still easy to pry off whenever you want to swap panels.Only the 12-button side panel has RGB, and the entire panel counts as a single LED, so you unfortunately can't customize the LED color of individual buttons (but you can program their individual functions). Also, the buttons on this panel are angled a little weird, and they're a little too flexible. Remember when you were a child, and your teeth would slowly become \"loose\" before falling out? These buttons feel similar to loose teeth, although they feel fairly comfortable to use and work perfectly well for their intended purpose. I didn't have much issue with accidentally pressing them with my thumb.The 6-button and 2-button panels are a lot more convenient than the 12-button panel for most scenarios. They both have a section underneath the buttons where you can place your thumb to properly grip the mouse. And the buttons on these panels feel a lot more like regular mouse buttons. Just keep in mind that the body of the mouse only has 2 sections with RGB - the scroll wheel and Razer logo.One thing I noticed is that the \"Profile\" button underneath the mouse is actually customizable. It has all the same reprogramming options as the rest of the buttons on the mouse. Not sure what it might be useful for, but thought that it's an excellent improvement over previous Razer mice I've used, which didn't allow that button to be changed.As a final note, I'd like to add that even if you aren't interested in the RGB lighting (it can be completely disabled), I highly recommend this mouse, as well as Razer mice in general. It may seem like Razer products are sought after mainly for their extensive use of RGB, but it turns out they make very good quality mice. If you're looking for a mouse with a lot of extra buttons, the Naga Pro is what you want."}

The past few weeks I’ve been using my laptop while relaxing on the couch and my wrist REALLY started to hurt with my old regular wireless mouse. I even got a wrist brace with insertable ice pack bc it got so bad. Finally took the plunge and am so glad I did. I don’t think I want to use a horizontal mouse anymore.Positive Findings:-The transition was WAY easier and faster than I thought. This mouse is much more suited for using anywhere except desks than horizontal mouses, imo. But it’s still good for that too! Just saying if you have a laptop and like to move around and use it in bed or something, this will be better to use than a horizontal mouse, imo.-I found that I’m better at keeping my wrist straight and am more so moving left and right by pivoting at my elbow instead of my wrist which I think helps a lot!-The button clicks are SO much quieter, full, poppy, and muted than most horizontal mouse’s buttons I’ve ever heard, which are usually super clicky, high pitched, and almost delicate sounding. This sound reminds me of those super nice custom keyboard keys, like the Holy Pandas that Taha uses for his custom build in the Answer In Progress’s video on mechanical keyboards (at 17:52). They don’t sound rattly and cagey like the keys on my membrane keyboard.-The buttons have a high quality, matte silicone feeling! Like if you’ve ever felt a really nice high quality silicone sex toy or vibrator that almost feels like silk, yeah. I was worried this was gonna feel like cheap  plastic all day but not at all.-I can rest this on the lower part of my laptop without any hiccups in mouse detection, unlike my horizontal mouse. I got a small track pad to keep on my laptop just in case but I don’t need it for thar. However I am using the trackpad for using the mouse on the couch and pillows, so.-Having a rechargeable battery AND the ability to use it while it was charging were extremely important to me, and this fits those criteria.-The charging cord is long enough for me to plug into my surge protector and use at my desk, but isn’t obnoxiously long like 10-15 feet.-I’m not accidentally bumping the back buttons by the thumb at all! I do this occasionally with my horizontal mouse and it is ANNOYING, especially if I had written a lot inside a form and hadn’t saved it yet. I was worried this would still happen but I’m pleased to report that it is actually kind of difficult to press them in that I have to stop and be very intentional about it. And I have decently big hands. I in nitrile gloves I’m a very snug medium size, teetering on the border of large.Disappointments:-I was, however, expecting it to hold my hand at a more vertical angle like 90 degrees. This more so puts your thumb at a 45 degree angle but I was kind of hoping for perfectly straight up. But maybe that wouldn’t be ergonomic.-I wish there were more DPI settings. Surprisingly, I would like higher DPI than 1600 with this which is strange bc I think I use 1200 or 1600 for my horizontal mouse. Oh well. It’s workable for sure and I can keep it on a 5” x 6” track pack no problem.Quirks:-I’m overthinking now which finger I normally use to scroll the scroll wheel. It doesn’t feel super right or seamless with the index or middle finger, but I’d have to do a better side by side comparison with my horizontal mouse. I could also not be holding it right and still getting used to it, I’ve only had it for about a week.Verdict: DO IT. Especially if you’re on the fence, doing a lot of research, gathering potential options, and whittling down your options after repeated comparisons like me. This is the cheapest one that has such great and necessary features and I’m shocked it is so cheap, actually."}

It started dying in a way I couldn't repair.  I had previously owned and loved a Corsair keyboard (which I had replaced a Black Widow Razer keyboard with) and thought I might try out the Scimitar.  The first time my Naga 2014 had a problem the Naga Trinity was still over a hundred bucks.  I didn't even check this time, just went with the Scimitar.The second I had it out of the package I knew it was too big in every way.  The side keys, the mouse wheel, the shape and height overall...  Too big for me.  My hand ached from simply trying to feel it out.  But I bought it when I -thought- I needed it and my Naga 2014 lasted me another couple months so...way outside the return window.  I forced myself to give it a go.So the first upset, after the size, was realizing that not only did I lose two binds (tilt left and right) but that I would not be able to use the ridiculously stiff middle mouse button.Obviously, the next step is to play with the software.  I download iCue as suggested with this product and at first, it seems great!  There's tons of options and I wade through the seemingly endless options setting everything up super nice.Let's check all the existing binds...oh, 1-12 isn't bound as 1-12...kind of a pain in the butt...okay let's use the 'profile switch' (typically DPI increase on most mice) as Ctrl-W for browsing...also to hotkey in WoW for healing...  And then I realized I'd lost two of my three mouse healing binds.  I use a gaming mouse to game with for specific reasons and being able to have all those mouse binds is integral to my gameplay...Whatever, let's see how this goes...spend a few days doing nothing important on games and just generally browsing on the PC.So I go through all the trouble of cleaning out the default stuff, setting up two profiles and the colors and  the macros/keybinds/windows tasks and give 'em a go.  Great!  Working great.  ...for...about...10 minutes.Now, at this point I've also picked up a Strafe keyboard.  Figure they might as well match.  And that thing is atrocious.  I liked it okay until I put it on my lap and realized the 2 freaking inch high keys weren't gonna work out for my standard play position.  But I digress, point is I set it up in the software as well with colors and between the two profiles.So yeah, ten minutes into gaming I move my mouse to the other screen to close a tab with Ctrl+W and it doesn't work.  Because (I later realized) every time I mouse off of WoW, the profile tries to change.  And in that time when it's trying to change, there's no keybind to the profile switch button which makes it a profile switch button.  So everything was borking out any time I alt tabbed through windows or moved my mouse to the wrong place.  So I take it down to one profile after a night of being confused and thinking there was just some weird lag going on.  The one profile works for a few hours and then it starts happening again so I check the app.  The iCue app has repopulated the profile list with the 5 default profiles (2 for the mouse and 3 for the keyboard iirc) and the profile switch button is doing both profile switching and CtrlW.  ...deep breaths.I spent the next week trying to make it work.  Any time I hibernated my PC or even randomly during the day, the profiles would repopulate.  At one point iCue even told me there was an error specifically because the default profiles weren't up there.  Uh, this is my system, I don't want those?  I deleted them for a reason?  If you have to have them, why is there a delete button?  Ctrl+W was my extra button hotkey and a heal macro.  So I'd be questing or healing and all of a sudden it wouldn't work.  Worse than that is that as I previously mentioned, 1-12 AREN'T BOUND by default.  So when you hit profile switch...bam, the mouse is useless.So basically at this point I've got an app that doesn't work and a mouse I hate and...naw.  I just said screw it.  I bought a Razer Trinity and Ornata V2.  The Trinity and the software are miles, lightyeeeaarrss, better than the Corsair products."}

I have to manually click and drag the scroll bar to scroll a window.this has become the normal plague for these MMO mice.

I used it for WoW and FF14 and it works good.

I've mainly been using wireless mice for everything for a few years and got this one because it was cheaper. I do kind of regret not spending the extra and getting a wireless mouse like the Razer Naga but this is fine.With the shape of the mouse I did have to slightly adjust my hand placement and it was pretty uncomfortable for a while but I'm used to it now. I would recommend anyone to try and find a store that might have mice on display like Best Buy and check first. If I did that I would probably not have purchased this mouse."}

{"asin": "B082LRMY53", "username": "John B", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nGood mouse, no doubt about it, but beware if you have larger hands", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021", "purchased": "Style: Wired", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "First of all I'll preface by saying that I'm unsure if the issue of my assigned keybinds resetting was an issue of ICUE software or if it's an issue with Windows 11. Either way, it's something to be noted that there's the possibility of your ICUE software resetting or scrambling your assigned keybinds when you reboot your PC. This issue won't affect the score I gave it since I can't pinpoint the exact cause of it.What will affect it however, is it's size. For a gaming mouse, the form factor is surprisingly small. I wear a medium/large size glove and this mouse was exceptionally uncomfortable if you're using it for it's defining feature: the programmable buttons on the left. In my natural mouse grip, my thumb rests on the frontmost row of buttons, making 123/456 the easiest to access. The 789 row just behind it is a bit uncomfortable to reach. The 10/11/12 row is very difficult without shifting my hand back on the mouse or curling my thumb too far inward, which is unnatural for me personally and made using the mouse significantly more difficult than I had previously expected. And yes, this is with the number buttons slid as far to the front as I could with the adjustment screw.Additionally, the buttons themselves are very small and feature very little textural difference to help distinguish them besides some very light texturing on alternating rows. Pressing multiple buttons or pressing the wrong button is very common, more common than I would like. Between the buttons being small, being hard to distinguish one from the other, and having larger hands make utilizing the full potential of this mouse extremely difficult.Finally, the left and right clickers are very light. The weight of my middle finger alone is enough to cause the right clicker to go off.My verdict is that the mouse is potentially very good, especially if your hands are on the smaller side. Gamers with larger hands might find this mouse uncomfortable to use if you prefer to choke up on the mouse like I do. I wouldn't *not* recommend it, but I would definitely keep the size of the mouse itself and the buttons in mind when making the recommendation."}

For the cost, the Corsair isn't a bad mouse, but I would 100% recommend trying one out in person first.I have smaller hands for a guy (sad), and I tend to grip the mouse with my ring and thumb a bit more. I made so many mis-clicks on the right click with this mouse it drove me insane. I can only assume it's because of my grip or how I rest my hand on the mouse, but it was annoying enough to make me look for another alternative. Definitely try one out if you can and see if it works.The required software is _bad_. It's extremely confusing to assign keys (for some reason there are two categories of keybindings, \"virtual\" keys and \"hardware\" keys). I don't know the difference, but I know it took over 10 minutes of googling to figure out how to make the \"1\" key actually output \"1\".The software will also occasionally completely stop working. While playing FFXIV in a dungeon, I all of a sudden saw the mouse lights turn off. The software had locked up. My mouse had become completely unresponsive. So there I am, a lowly DPS standing in AOE cones trying to figure out why I can't turn around or pop any of my skills. It was because the corsair software had decided to bug out and freeze, losing all my mouse functionality.Another nit - the marketing. Razer knows who they're marketing to, and they stick to it. Corsair doesn't seem to know if they want to be \"Serious Gamers\" or \"LOL Gamer boyz&girlz!\" This box has the phrase \"Control Freak\" on the side. Now maybe I'm making a mountain out of mole hill, it's just the box, right? But every time I look at the box and see that, I like this product a bit less. I'm not a \"Control Freak\", I'm a guy that wants good products and hardware without childish terms being thrown at me by the manufacturer. So maybe my relationship with the scimitar started out on already shaky ground, just because of the box.Would I recommend this - probably not. If I could go back I would just save a bit more at first and buy the razer. I'm not really a Razer fanboy, but the naga is just a superior product."}

I do like that it has a silent click to it so if you're gaming at night or next to someone, it wont bother them, you cant hear anything. Overall a great mouse for the money though"}

Not to mention the auxillary buttons on the side of the mouse that helps with general stuff while surfing the web.The battery life of the mouse isn't bad either, and can be used for 1-2 weeks straight without the need to recharge (talking from someone who uses their laptop 8-12 hours daily here).The automatic sleep mode is the only thing that I can find unappealing, and while I understand that it's to save the battery of the mouse, it can become somewhat annoying to handle."}

This is a huge gesture and great sign they stand behind their products. I haven't had any issues with the new mouse and I still stand behind my initial positive review and impressions. This is a great mouse and it's refreshing to have an awesome company that stands behind their products. Very impressed and excited to be using this mouse again! Feels great and smooth for gaming and general use. It's so nice to have it looking great with my keyboard and setup as a whole again! Will keep this review updated. Thanks again for the awesome service!Update 1: I don't know if it's just my mouse specifically, (apparently it was after receiving a new one from them that works great.) but after having this mouse for a few weeks I've noticed the battery life is almost not worth it being a wireless mouse. It loses precision quickly and I end up leaving it plugged in most of the time. I've switched to a cheaper wired mouse for now that works better/more consistently.Original review: I've been using this as a general/gaming mouse so far and it's been surprisingly great for the price.It's been hard for me to find a nice wireless white gaming mouse, especially for a good deal. I bought a couple other cheap gaming mice and this one was by far the best for me. The silent but still tactile main buttons feel nice as well as the rubber grippy scroll wheel.It's also light and super smooth on my mouse pad compared to all other mice I've used. This surprised me as a predominant factor in keeping it over the others I tried. It just felt so smooth switching back and forth between others. I haven't had any problems with the wireless signal or double clicks etc. It's been very accurate and lag free so far.I really like the design. Looks clean imo. The only thing I wish was a bit different is the led when it's turned on. it's a little bit off center to the left. I wish the lighting was a little more even all around and even a little brighter. I realize I'm being pretty nitpicky for such a budget and wireless mouse, but I figured I'd throw it out there.It's a lot nicer looking, including the lighting, than the other mice I tried in this budget. I can't find a better one for me on Amazon for under $20. (Especially in white with nerdy LED's haha. There doesn't seem to be a huge selection from what I could find.) Very satisfied with this mouse so far."}

I’d imagine somebody needing it full-time would know better on that, but for my part-time purposes it’s so much fun.

I will try to put some lubricant on it to quiet it down. I have gotten a little more used to the shape of it, but it still doesn't feel completely comfortable. I'd still recommend it just based on the price and the fact that it is definitely a quiet click.My two-day review.I bought this mouse for the silent click, which it delivers. Super silent and has a more \"shallow\" click than my old mouse, which feels faster for gaming. The RGB lights look awesome and I like that there is a button to turn the lights off to save battery.My issue is the feel/shape of the mouse. I'd say I have average size hands for an adult male and this mouse feels big and awkward. The spot for your thumb is too shallow to grip well, while the right side feels too deep and positioned too low for your fingers to sit comfortably. My ring finger sits on the top \"edge\" of the mouse rather than the side. Almost feels like its made for the left hand. This along with the slick brand new plastic, makes it hard to grip. I am constantly regripping and repositioning.  The two buttons on the thumb side feel too \"tall\", meaning they have to be pressed in quite a bit for the click to register. I don't really use those buttons though so no issue for me.Maybe some more time to adjust and a little hand gunk will make it easier to hang on to. I can't complain much for $11.Side Note: The instructions say the charging LED is blue. Mine is red. Not a big deal but I wasn't sure if it was charging or not the first time."}

As a multi-genre gamer that mainly plays MMOs but occasionally dabbles in other genres like shooters, the Trinity concept is perfect. The Naga Pro feels like slightly upgraded and wireless available version of an already great mouse. If you're a fan of the original Naga Trinity or looking for a great all-around wireless gaming mouse with a large number of buttons, the Naga Pro comes as a strong recommendation.Longer version: I've always liked the general feel of the Naga mouse - not too big, not too small, relatively ergonomic to my average if not slightly smaller hand size for a guy. I've been using the mouse and its different versions since the OG back in 2009, and my favorite version was the 2014 Epic Chroma that also had a wireless option. Since then, Naga mice haven't supported wireless. That's unfortunate as I like the clean desk look of a wireless mouse, and get annoyed by the \"tug\" of the cable despite trying some gadgets that try to wrangle cables in the ideal positions. The downside for wireless, purportedly, is the delay versus wired mouse. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference. It feels instantaneous to me. Wired vs Wireless is only something that matters to professional gamers, when every tiny detail gives an edge over the competition. But for 99% of gamers out there, your skill is going to define your performance/ranking far more than something like a minuscule amount of delay on your mouse. Suffice to say, it's not going to turn your game around enough to choose wired over wireless if you generally prefer wireless. Razer touts its \"Hyperspeed\" wireless - I don't know how much of that is just marketing nonsense. To my feeling, the responsiveness at least compares to my Logitech G305, which I use for my setup in my living room with my nVIDIA Shield.Now I'll ramble a bit about Naga as a product line. I've gone through like 6 different Naga mouse over the years - none of them broke; they've all performed great. I only upgraded them because of wanting features, or because they  were getting too grimy after many hours of use (which as an MMO gamer, they have gotten many hundreds of hours of mileage). Firstly, if you're generally in the market for a MMO mouse and looking at the different options out there, I think the Naga has always been the best. I've tried some of the others out there from Corsair and Logitech. They're decent products, but ultimately the thing that has me coming back is the physical ergonomics of the Naga. I love the shape of the mouse, and the 12 buttons are easy to differentiate from each other by the individual button contours. It doesn't even need \"bumps\" to help you train your muscle memory (which would eventually erode over time, trust me). The only downside is that I feel like the last three buttons (10, 11, and 12) are difficult to hit without hand strain, but this may be because of my smaller sized hand and getting older.That being said, 1 through 9 is still some great button real estate. As far as playing MMOs, I consider the Naga (or a similar mouse) essential. I honestly don't know how I used to play without them. You can use them as additional button binds, or you can replicate your number keys to give your hands some different options to hit the same keys (which I do to overcome hand strain from long hours of play). If you've never tried a mouse like this and aren't sure if it's worth it  - it is. The only challenge is the initial learning curve. It took me several weeks to really get used to using the mouse, but once I did, there was no going back. It helps so much in raiding, for example, when you might need to be running around with WASD while also hitting a complex button rotation. Doing this is night and day between having a Naga and not having a Naga.Now, I'll zero in on the Naga Pro. This only just came out, so I can't review it for things like battery longevity. That being said, Razer's not new to the PC product game, so I have nor reason to doubt in its technical specifications for the charge time. Out of the box, the mouse does feel very similar to the Trinity, if not exactly the same. The shape is the same, the side button contours are the same, and the materials seem the same. The materials I think are perhaps the only slight downfall of the product - it has a bit of a plasticy feel to it; I wish the product felt more solid. That being said, the light weight does help in situations like FPS gaming, when you need to move the mouse quickly. For a chunkier sized mouse, it's not a bad weight. But if you solely game FPS, the Naga would be hard to recommend. There are lighter mice out there, and you might want to consider something wired. That being said, if you are just a casual FPS gamer, or playing something like Borderlands, the Naga works just fine, if not outstanding with the additional button potential. The hot-swappable left panel is one of the coolest innovations in gaming mice tech I've seen in years. It works instantly and without a hitch. It snaps in place magnetically - it feels solid and never like it's a weird attachment.Speaking about the additional buttons, that's another thing that's changed over the Trinity. The hot-swappable left panel has gotten rid of one panel in exchange for another. Instead of the \"circular\" button layout designed for MOBAs (which tbh I never used, even as someone who occasionally plays MOBAs), there is a more condensed 1-6 button layout. It's kind of a nice option for people who play MMOs with fewer keybinds like Guild Wars 2, or someone who can't reach all 12 buttons. I see this as an improvement over the Trinity, as I never used the circular button layout and could potentially use the 1-6 grid layout.Long story short (too late), so far, I think the Naga Pro is great. It maintains the greatness of the Trinity product and brings in to a wireless version. If you liked the Trinity, you will like the Naga Pro. If you did not like the Trinity, you will not like the Naga Pro. If you're new in the market for a MMO mouse, I recommend trying it out. Be gentle with it though and leave yourself the option to return if you don't like it. Some people complain about the scroll wheel, but I've never had an issue there. Suffice to say, mice are personal and subjective peripherals, and things like shape and ergonomics differ in preference from person to person. This might not be the mouse for you. But as a concept, it's executed well and one of the best on market. The final downside is the price - it's on the expensive side. But for me, input is how you interact with your game - it's the connection between you and what's happening in-game. It's worth investing in as a core part of your setup."}

As a passionate gamer, this mouse has taken my gameplay to a whole new level of control, versatility, and precision.First and foremost, I have to mention the wireless functionality of the Naga Pro. It’s absolutely seamless and reliable. The 2.4GHz HyperSpeed wireless technology ensures a super-fast and lag-free connection, giving me the freedom to move around without any restrictions. I’m impressed with how responsive it is; it feels just as good as using a wired gaming mouse. With no worries about input delay, it creates an immersive and enjoyable gaming environment.One of the standout features of the Naga Pro is its modular design. I love how the side plates are interchangeable, allowing me to customize the mouse to match different game genres and playstyles. Whether I’m playing an MMO and need the classic 12-button layout, diving into a MOBA with a 6-button configuration, or engaging in FPS games with a clean and minimalistic layout, this mouse has got me covered. The magnetic attachment system is a breeze to use, and it keeps the side plates securely in place during intense gaming sessions.Speaking of buttons, the Naga Pro has mechanical switches that feel amazing to click. They’re tactile, responsive, and consistent. Each click provides a satisfying feedback that adds to the overall gaming experience. The button placement is well-thought-out and easily accessible, enabling quick and seamless execution of complex commands. It’s also worth mentioning that the ability to assign macros and remap buttons using Razer Synapse software adds an extra layer of customization, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs.The Naga Pro’s 20,000 DPI Focus+ optical sensor is a beast in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. It offers flawless tracking, even during the most intense and fast-paced gaming moments. Being able to customize the DPI settings allows me to fine-tune the mouse’s sensitivity to match my preferences perfectly. This ensures precise aiming and pixel-perfect accuracy, which is a significant advantage, especially in competitive gaming.Comfort is key during long gaming sessions, and the Naga Pro delivers in that department. The ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly, providing a comfortable and natural grip. The mouse glides smoothly across different surfaces, thanks to its PTFE feet, reducing fatigue and giving me better control. The build quality is exceptional, too, with a sturdy construction that feels durable and reliable.Last but not least, let’s talk about battery life. The Naga Pro impresses with its long-lasting battery. I can enjoy up to 150 hours of uninterrupted gaming on a single charge, which means I rarely have to reach for the charging cable. Plus, the included charging dock makes it incredibly convenient to keep the mouse charged when I’m not using it. The fact that I can continue gaming while it’s charging is a testament to the versatility and convenience of this fantastic gaming mouse.In conclusion, the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is an absolute must-have for gamers who are serious about their gameplay. Its wireless capabilities, modular design, precise tracking, and ergonomic feel make it a powerhouse in the gaming world. With the Naga Pro, you can unleash your gaming potential and elevate your gameplay to new heights!Disclaimer: I received no compensation or incentives for writing this review. I genuinely believe in the quality and performance of the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse."}

My mind has been COMPLETELY changed! even being on the low end price wise for a good mouse this thing packs a punch. It's got a nice braided cable that doesn't look like it's going to wear out in a few months. its got a finger rest on the side which is GREAT for someone like me with larger hands. without the rest my ring and pinkie fingers would always get fatigued just dragging beside the mouse but no more! It's also got the simple to use keypad to use with your thumb on the side which has not only made gaming easier, it has also upped productivity when doing other work as you can program all 12 buttons to do different things all to your liking. Lastly you've got the chroma lighting that can also be VASTLY customized. best part is that it mostly plug and play but you will be asked to install Razer software which isn't a problem because it's needed to customize the mouse. Overall this has been the best mouse I have used in my experience with computers over the years."}

Really enjoy the lighting customization with a Razor keyboard as well as the ability to customize the adjustable DPI on the mouse.Only issue myself and others have consistently ran into is that every once in a while the mouse will either fail to recognize the side button presses or will fail to recognize the side completely. In the early stages of this disease you can remove the panel and put it back on, clean the pins, or push the panel into the mouse, but once it progresses enough you either have to get a new mouse or send it into Razor to have it fixed / replaced.

If you are a gamer, a video editor, or you like to play around in any program and need more shortcuts, this mouse will change your life.I've tested single-handed computer operation in games and adobe creative suite using this mouse, and it can help people tremendously.

The Naga is my favorite because of its shape. I have rather large hands and long fingers, and the way this mouse sits in my palm is pretty much perfect. Very ergonomic and solid grip. Sure, DeathAdder as well as Mamba are also very comfortable, but there's something special about having this heavy & big mouse, with the arching bulge, under my palm. I feel very much in control of its movement and, actually, appreciate its weight. It's precise and customizable enough for my needs. The three RGB zones may be lacking to some, but, really, it all comes down to how comfortable a mouse feels and not how it looks.I like its clicky somewhat stiffer buttons. The main buttons take a bit of effort to actuate than the buttons on DeathAdder or Mamba but I like that feeling. There are less accidental miss-clicks. Perhaps a professional CS:GO player would appreciate the light weight and sensitivity of DeathAdder, but I, just a casual gamer that plays a lot of story-driven FPS and RPGs, really dig the Naga. Sure, the sensor it has can't be as fine-tuned with the software as the one in the DeathAdder, but this aspect has 0 difference to me personally.  And don't get me wrong, the sensor it has is very good, probably the same hardware, in fact, that goes up to 16000 DPI -- it just can't be as minutely adjusted by software as on some of other Razer mice. I use stock presets. Low sensitivity for FPS, higher sensitivity for RTS, etc. The stock sensitivity options are plenty sufficient to me but can be modified to some extent by the Synapse.I am sure a lot of people would seek this mouse not for its shape but for the fact that it has three panels for the left side with various button layouts. I do find that having the extra buttons is nice and I've been learning to utilize them more. It feels awesome having all 12 of my most used spells in WoW being accessible by the thumb. It does take a bit of practice to get good with those buttons but it's really worth it, especially when it comes to PVP. The fact that you don't have to use the panel with 12 buttons if you don't want to, and could have a panel with 7 or 3 -- is very nifty. Certain titles might work better with the lesser number of buttons and switching them on the go is effortless. It really is like having three mice in one. Others noted that the replaceable panels feel very solid and I will note that too. There's no give or any kind of rattling. They sit in secured by magnets the way that you can't even tell that they are replaceable. I think that's certainly a big win for the design.I can't comment on the reliability or how long this mouse would last. I see a lot of negative comments from people that complain of the buttons' failure. I haven't experienced any of this yet, though I haven't used this mouse for a long time. My other two Razer mice -- the DeathAdder Elite and the Mamba Elite -- have no issues. The DeathAdder is nearly 5 years old since I purchased it. It sill runs strong and there's only mild wear, for the most part it still looks like new. Sure, Naga is a very different model than the other two and it may behave differently, but so far Razer got a very good, nearly excellent, track-record with me. Otherwise I wouldn't purchase this mouse in the first place.The three RGB zones may put some people away but to me it doesn't matter. I don't stare at my mouse when I play and the comfort of use is way more important than the pretty lights. The Mamba Elite has some very extensive RGB to it and I have it plugged in for the pretty effects (starlight looks awesome on its sides!), and it's more of a display piece now on my desk than my daily driver. The Naga, on the other hand, has become the daily driver that I very much enjoy using. I wish I bought it as my first Razer mouse, so that by now I would have been a pro with the extra buttons!"}

As a long time WoW player since original TBC, I have used every mouse you can think of. When MMO mouses came out and I made the switch to using them, I have tried them all. I settled on the Naga Trinity which I have been using now for the last few years. Do they last long? Not really. I think I have been through around 4 or 5 Trinitys since I have used them. Either a side button stops working when pressed and doesn't register everytime or the scroll wheel gets really notchy and hard to use which I use alot. My last 2 Trinitys were bad scroll wheels. When playing I use scroll wheel up/down/click with shift modifiers whether it's arena targeting or other class abilities. Also the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel I remap to ALT and Shift so I can hold that button down and use a key on my keyboard for a bind.I decided to try the Naga X this time recommend by a rank 1 glad player and it's nothing but amazing and an improvement over the Trinity IMO. It's noticeably lighter by a lot. Doesn't it feel sort of like cheap plastic? Yes, but I could care less. That's why it is light. I noticed the razer symbol on the back of the mouse doesn't light up like it does on the Trinity. I could care less, hand is covering that part of the mouse anyways. That's probably also why it lighter. Does the X have interchangeable side panels for the amount of buttons you want on the side? No, that's why I'm buying an MMO mouse so that's not important to me. If I wanted a mouse with 2 or 6 buttons than I'd be buying something else. Just a marketing thing in my eyes for the Trinity to give people more options. The PTFE feet seem to glide better and feel smoother. The speed flex cable on the X is amazing compared to the stiff Trinity cable, another plus. I've never been a fan of wireless mice like the Naga Pro for example. I don't ever want to worry about battery life or my mouse to stop working. It's like wireless internet compared to wired. An ethernet connection is much more secure and something less to worry about as with anything wired. A mouse is no different. The side buttons feel the same between the two, nice light click and responsive. The scroll wheel on the X beats the Trinity hands down. The reason is because the Trinity has tilt left/right and the X does not. That tilt left/right causes the scroll wheel to feel loose overtime and with my experience causes the gear in the scroll wheel to get notchy and cause scrolling problems. I never used tilt scroll wheel so it's not important to me. The scroll wheel on the X is solid and smooth as butter. No tilt left/right but nice solid smooth scroll up/down/click. The X only has one big button behind the scroll wheel which I remaped to ALT. For some reason I find hitting that 1 big button easier than the 2 buttons on the Trinity. I can live without a 2nd button, didn't really use it tbh. Can't miss it or fat finger a second button. Not really sure what else to say other than I'd highly recommend giving the X a shot if what I've listed is important to you. Time will tell now how the X holds up compared to the Trinity overtime but the Naga X is my new go to mouse. Going to buy another as a backup because they are on sale and I can buy 2 for the price of 1 Trinity."}
{"asin": "B0788MCRGC", "username": "Eric Peterson", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nNaga Pro brings positives of Naga Trinity to a wireless mode", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020", "purchased": "Size: MouseStyle: Naga Pro", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "TL;DR - I've been waiting for a new wireless version of the Naga for some time now. As a multi-genre gamer that mainly plays MMOs but occasionally dabbles in other genres like shooters, the Trinity concept is perfect. The Naga Pro feels like slightly upgraded and wireless available version of an already great mouse. If you're a fan of the original Naga Trinity or looking for a great all-around wireless gaming mouse with a large number of buttons, the Naga Pro comes as a strong recommendation.Longer version: I've always liked the general feel of the Naga mouse - not too big, not too small, relatively ergonomic to my average if not slightly smaller hand size for a guy. I've been using the mouse and its different versions since the OG back in 2009, and my favorite version was the 2014 Epic Chroma that also had a wireless option. Since then, Naga mice haven't supported wireless. That's unfortunate as I like the clean desk look of a wireless mouse, and get annoyed by the \"tug\" of the cable despite trying some gadgets that try to wrangle cables in the ideal positions. The downside for wireless, purportedly, is the delay versus wired mouse. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference. It feels instantaneous to me. Wired vs Wireless is only something that matters to professional gamers, when every tiny detail gives an edge over the competition. But for 99% of gamers out there, your skill is going to define your performance/ranking far more than something like a minuscule amount of delay on your mouse. Suffice to say, it's not going to turn your game around enough to choose wired over wireless if you generally prefer wireless. Razer touts its \"Hyperspeed\" wireless - I don't know how much of that is just marketing nonsense. To my feeling, the responsiveness at least compares to my Logitech G305, which I use for my setup in my living room with my nVIDIA Shield.Now I'll ramble a bit about Naga as a product line. I've gone through like 6 different Naga mouse over the years - none of them broke; they've all performed great. I only upgraded them because of wanting features, or because they  were getting too grimy after many hours of use (which as an MMO gamer, they have gotten many hundreds of hours of mileage). Firstly, if you're generally in the market for a MMO mouse and looking at the different options out there, I think the Naga has always been the best. I've tried some of the others out there from Corsair and Logitech. They're decent products, but ultimately the thing that has me coming back is the physical ergonomics of the Naga. I love the shape of the mouse, and the 12 buttons are easy to differentiate from each other by the individual button contours. It doesn't even need \"bumps\" to help you train your muscle memory (which would eventually erode over time, trust me). The only downside is that I feel like the last three buttons (10, 11, and 12) are difficult to hit without hand strain, but this may be because of my smaller sized hand and getting older.That being said, 1 through 9 is still some great button real estate. As far as playing MMOs, I consider the Naga (or a similar mouse) essential. I honestly don't know how I used to play without them. You can use them as additional button binds, or you can replicate your number keys to give your hands some different options to hit the same keys (which I do to overcome hand strain from long hours of play). If you've never tried a mouse like this and aren't sure if it's worth it  - it is. The only challenge is the initial learning curve. It took me several weeks to really get used to using the mouse, but once I did, there was no going back. It helps so much in raiding, for example, when you might need to be running around with WASD while also hitting a complex button rotation. Doing this is night and day between having a Naga and not having a Naga.Now, I'll zero in on the Naga Pro. This only just came out, so I can't review it for things like battery longevity. That being said, Razer's not new to the PC product game, so I have nor reason to doubt in its technical specifications for the charge time. Out of the box, the mouse does feel very similar to the Trinity, if not exactly the same. The shape is the same, the side button contours are the same, and the materials seem the same. The materials I think are perhaps the only slight downfall of the product - it has a bit of a plasticy feel to it; I wish the product felt more solid. That being said, the light weight does help in situations like FPS gaming, when you need to move the mouse quickly. For a chunkier sized mouse, it's not a bad weight. But if you solely game FPS, the Naga would be hard to recommend. There are lighter mice out there, and you might want to consider something wired. That being said, if you are just a casual FPS gamer, or playing something like Borderlands, the Naga works just fine, if not outstanding with the additional button potential. The hot-swappable left panel is one of the coolest innovations in gaming mice tech I've seen in years. It works instantly and without a hitch. It snaps in place magnetically - it feels solid and never like it's a weird attachment.Speaking about the additional buttons, that's another thing that's changed over the Trinity. The hot-swappable left panel has gotten rid of one panel in exchange for another. Instead of the \"circular\" button layout designed for MOBAs (which tbh I never used, even as someone who occasionally plays MOBAs), there is a more condensed 1-6 button layout. It's kind of a nice option for people who play MMOs with fewer keybinds like Guild Wars 2, or someone who can't reach all 12 buttons. I see this as an improvement over the Trinity, as I never used the circular button layout and could potentially use the 1-6 grid layout.Long story short (too late), so far, I think the Naga Pro is great. It maintains the greatness of the Trinity product and brings in to a wireless version. If you liked the Trinity, you will like the Naga Pro. If you did not like the Trinity, you will not like the Naga Pro. If you're new in the market for a MMO mouse, I recommend trying it out. Be gentle with it though and leave yourself the option to return if you don't like it. Some people complain about the scroll wheel, but I've never had an issue there. Suffice to say, mice are personal and subjective peripherals, and things like shape and ergonomics differ in preference from person to person. This might not be the mouse for you. But as a concept, it's executed well and one of the best on market. The final downside is the price - it's on the expensive side. But for me, input is how you interact with your game - it's the connection between you and what's happening in-game. It's worth investing in as a core part of your setup."}

As a passionate gamer, this mouse has taken my gameplay to a whole new level of control, versatility, and precision.First and foremost, I have to mention the wireless functionality of the Naga Pro. It’s absolutely seamless and reliable. The 2.4GHz HyperSpeed wireless technology ensures a super-fast and lag-free connection, giving me the freedom to move around without any restrictions. I’m impressed with how responsive it is; it feels just as good as using a wired gaming mouse. With no worries about input delay, it creates an immersive and enjoyable gaming environment.One of the standout features of the Naga Pro is its modular design. I love how the side plates are interchangeable, allowing me to customize the mouse to match different game genres and playstyles. Whether I’m playing an MMO and need the classic 12-button layout, diving into a MOBA with a 6-button configuration, or engaging in FPS games with a clean and minimalistic layout, this mouse has got me covered. The magnetic attachment system is a breeze to use, and it keeps the side plates securely in place during intense gaming sessions.Speaking of buttons, the Naga Pro has mechanical switches that feel amazing to click. They’re tactile, responsive, and consistent. Each click provides a satisfying feedback that adds to the overall gaming experience. The button placement is well-thought-out and easily accessible, enabling quick and seamless execution of complex commands. It’s also worth mentioning that the ability to assign macros and remap buttons using Razer Synapse software adds an extra layer of customization, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs.The Naga Pro’s 20,000 DPI Focus+ optical sensor is a beast in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. It offers flawless tracking, even during the most intense and fast-paced gaming moments. Being able to customize the DPI settings allows me to fine-tune the mouse’s sensitivity to match my preferences perfectly. This ensures precise aiming and pixel-perfect accuracy, which is a significant advantage, especially in competitive gaming.Comfort is key during long gaming sessions, and the Naga Pro delivers in that department. The ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly, providing a comfortable and natural grip. The mouse glides smoothly across different surfaces, thanks to its PTFE feet, reducing fatigue and giving me better control. The build quality is exceptional, too, with a sturdy construction that feels durable and reliable.Last but not least, let’s talk about battery life. The Naga Pro impresses with its long-lasting battery. I can enjoy up to 150 hours of uninterrupted gaming on a single charge, which means I rarely have to reach for the charging cable. Plus, the included charging dock makes it incredibly convenient to keep the mouse charged when I’m not using it. The fact that I can continue gaming while it’s charging is a testament to the versatility and convenience of this fantastic gaming mouse.In conclusion, the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is an absolute must-have for gamers who are serious about their gameplay. Its wireless capabilities, modular design, precise tracking, and ergonomic feel make it a powerhouse in the gaming world. With the Naga Pro, you can unleash your gaming potential and elevate your gameplay to new heights!Disclaimer: I received no compensation or incentives for writing this review. I genuinely believe in the quality and performance of the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse."}

My mind has been COMPLETELY changed! even being on the low end price wise for a good mouse this thing packs a punch. It's got a nice braided cable that doesn't look like it's going to wear out in a few months. its got a finger rest on the side which is GREAT for someone like me with larger hands. without the rest my ring and pinkie fingers would always get fatigued just dragging beside the mouse but no more! It's also got the simple to use keypad to use with your thumb on the side which has not only made gaming easier, it has also upped productivity when doing other work as you can program all 12 buttons to do different things all to your liking. Lastly you've got the chroma lighting that can also be VASTLY customized. best part is that it mostly plug and play but you will be asked to install Razer software which isn't a problem because it's needed to customize the mouse. Overall this has been the best mouse I have used in my experience with computers over the years."}

Really enjoy the lighting customization with a Razor keyboard as well as the ability to customize the adjustable DPI on the mouse.Only issue myself and others have consistently ran into is that every once in a while the mouse will either fail to recognize the side button presses or will fail to recognize the side completely. In the early stages of this disease you can remove the panel and put it back on, clean the pins, or push the panel into the mouse, but once it progresses enough you either have to get a new mouse or send it into Razor to have it fixed / replaced.

Finally, I landed on the Naga Pro, and I've been extensively using this mouse for around a month. If you are a gamer, a video editor, or you like to play around in any program and need more shortcuts, this mouse will change your life.I've tested single-handed computer operation in games and adobe creative suite using this mouse, and it can help people tremendously. If you get an injury, you don't have to stop gaming. Just bind some of those keys onto the mouse and keep going. For example, I spent the majority of my time playing Diablo 4 using only this mouse.Pros:-Up to 19 programmable buttons-Battery Life lasts ~1 1/2 days (considerable use)-Configurable Plates for different button preferences-Glides much nicer than expected, and its feet seem higher quality than my old Naga-Chroma (lights)-Left & Right click on the scroll wheel have been a gamer changer for me-Option to use Bluetooth, wired mode, or the included dongle. Switching between the three is easy too.-Often on sale and not too different from the Naga Pro 2, but much cheaper-Uses Synapse 3, so it will be supported for quite a while Cons:-Side buttons are very sensitive (this could also be a pro, depending on the user)-The left and right clicks are somewhat heavy and seem to take a bit more effort to push down-Louder clicks than some options out there-Still not the cheapest option out there"}

The Naga is my favorite because of its shape. I have rather large hands and long fingers, and the way this mouse sits in my palm is pretty much perfect. Very ergonomic and solid grip. Sure, DeathAdder as well as Mamba are also very comfortable, but there's something special about having this heavy & big mouse, with the arching bulge, under my palm. I feel very much in control of its movement and, actually, appreciate its weight. It's precise and customizable enough for my needs. The three RGB zones may be lacking to some, but, really, it all comes down to how comfortable a mouse feels and not how it looks.I like its clicky somewhat stiffer buttons. The main buttons take a bit of effort to actuate than the buttons on DeathAdder or Mamba but I like that feeling. There are less accidental miss-clicks. Perhaps a professional CS:GO player would appreciate the light weight and sensitivity of DeathAdder, but I, just a casual gamer that plays a lot of story-driven FPS and RPGs, really dig the Naga. Sure, the sensor it has can't be as fine-tuned with the software as the one in the DeathAdder, but this aspect has 0 difference to me personally.  And don't get me wrong, the sensor it has is very good, probably the same hardware, in fact, that goes up to 16000 DPI -- it just can't be as minutely adjusted by software as on some of other Razer mice.

Now I got the Naga Trinity. A quick wiki search tells me there have been nine iterations in the Naga series, not counting the redesigned versions and I must say I have never not liked one of my MMO/MOBA mice from RΛZΞR. And I'm not one of them gamer lifestyle junkies or uber Razer fanboys that goes out and buys everything chroma and wears their clothing or nothing. In fact, I actually own plenty of varying brands across my gaming peripherals including Corsair, Logitech, etc. I just like Razers products when it comes to their M+K options. Mice specifically being reviwed here, because they are quality and I trust them as one of the premier gaming hardware manufacturing companies. There are many of these brands out there for PC to choose from these days but Razer is right at the top IMHO..The mouse:After years of using the original Naga, then Hex v2, and now Naga Trinity I got use to  this style of mouse configuration and how the ergonomics or placement of your hand sits on them. It rests a little differently so you might feel awkward at first but trust me you will get use to it with repitition in no time.I liked to keep my muscle memory the same so when my original Naga wore out I looked for another. I ended up going with Hex v2 because the Naga had been phased out with the emergence of popular MOBA's they redesigned it a little bit. I was reluctant to buy that one because i wanted my 12 buttons in 3x4 pattern not the circular 7 buttons. But I got use to it and it sufficed until the Trinity was released.Once the Trinity came out it gives you the best of all worlds really. You can swap out the side button options to what you prefer or need for any specific game you want to play. Or any program you wanna use your mouse with (non-gaming).Which brings me to my next point in Razer mice. They have top notch lasers in them, very accurate. While the implications for gaming are obvious here just as a everyday mouse for anyone using a PC they are worthy of a purchase. They last a long time. Tons of clicks and scrolls on the scroll wheel before they wear down and need to be replaced. Talking years of usage. And I'm a heavy PC user. Not just for games either. Once you use it awhile the tactile feel of the mouse scroll does go away but everything functions fine still. I actually prefer getting them worn in tbh.Lastly, I'm one of the people who actually has no gripes about their hardware configuration tool Synapse. It works flawlessly for me and wasn't that hard to learn either. The tool offers a lot of customization for what each button on the mouse does what even letting you keybind a custom function like Shift+Q to a single button press if you wanna get complex. Also want to point out that on the bottom of this mouse there is a button that quickly swaps profiles so you can set up a profile for each game you are playing. or some MMO games you play different class/job so you can have a different profile and have the buttons do something else on each. Customizing and keybinding to your hearts desire really. Then of course the Synapse has the DPI options and the superfluous stuff like lighting options which is nice and I get why they include it but not wholly needed.All in all you won't be disappointed by this mouse. No matter if you play MMO's/MOBA's/Shooters/or don't game at all. I almost bought two just because i know when it wears out years down the road I'm just going to want to replace it with another one."}

You buy something like this (as opposed to just a regular old mouse) when you want some extra buttons on your mouse compared to a more basic one and want to have more control over exactly what your mouse does.

This includes changing what the buttons do, changing the lighting (or removing it entirely if you prefer), and changing the sensitivity.Recently I tried two top gaming mice, the Corsair Nightsword and this Razer Naga Trinity. I first got the Naga Trinity and would have stayed with it but I had some double-clicking issues when it first arrived. Sometimes when I tried to click things or select text, it would do an extra click or not click at all, which was quite frustrating. I had no choice but to either replace it or try a different mouse, and I opted for the latter.Before I continue, do note that I have pretty large hands (8.25\" from middle finger tip to the crease on my wrist, 4\" across the widest part of my palm (across the knuckles), and nearly 10\" from my thumb tip to my pinky tip when my hands are open wide as if I were trying to palm a basketball) and I use a fintertip style grip (see pictures) on my mouse — your own hand size and grip style will determine whether each of these mice is a good fit for you.Here is what I like and dislike about each, with points from -3 to +3 next to each point which indicate how much I like or dislike each feature (-3 being very much dislike, +3 being very much like):Corsair Nightsword:A.

Strangely, it seems to occur much less now for no reason I can explain, but if it happens even one more time I'm going to have to replace the mouse. Note: My particular mouse might simply be defective, but other reviewers have said this is an issue for them as well so clearly there's some sort of quality control issue.For me, the 12-button side panel is great because the way I naturally use the mouse my thumb rests right in the center of all the buttons, making them all accessible if need-be (though pressing the middle buttons is a bit trickier, at least I can reach all of them whereas my partner with smaller hands cannot easily press all the buttons even if she wanted to).I'll probably stick with the Razer Naga trinity (and re-order a new one if the clicking issues persist) simply because the side buttons are difficult to reach for me with the Corsair Nightsword, but I hope I provided enough detail so you can make a more-informed decision for yourself. :)"}

I mostly use it for work, and it's equally comfortable in my hand and easier on my wrist because it's so much lighter and easier to move. It doesn't have side scrolling, but I mapped the thumb buttons to scroll, and it works great. Also, clicking the scroll wheel enables scroll-based-on-offset mode which is great for scrolling (either vertically or horizontally) without needing to keep scrolling the wheel or pressing the button. Also, it's now much easier to drag things exactly one pixel for graphics work, which I didn't realize was previously frustrating until it started being easy with this mouse. Overall very useable for work.For gaming, this mouse is a huge step up. I mostly play StarCraft 2, and since getting the new mouse my accuracy is way better - I didn't realize how slow I had to move before to make sure I was clicking the right thing! It really feels like my hand suddenly got more coordinated. I don't do FPS much anymore, but I imagine it would make a big difference there too. Not a ton of buttons, so maybe not great for RPGs where you want to map a ton of things. But the core point-and-click experience is really great."}

The mouse's feet/skates looked like somebody took the mouse for a test drive before putting it back inside a box. The sides of the scroll wheel looked shabby, as if somebody was scratching them with long nails.The software support of the new and the old versions are like night and day. The new version works only with infamous G Hub software, while the old version can work with either G Hub or Logitech Gaming software. While both software programs are horrible and unnecessary in their own unique ways, The Gaming software lets you at least turn off LEDs. That is right; G Hub does not have an option of turning off LEDs on the wireless mouse, which has a limited battery life. The only way to do that is through on board memory configurator, which is like a small .exe file, which lets you configure your mouse without installing any kind of manufacturers’ software/bloatware. Another good point in Gaming software is that it has a notification for when the battery drops to 30 percent of battery life, which is quite useful for prolonging the battery’s factory lifespan. G Hub has that too, but for some reason, it malfunctions from time to time. The only thing I would have added is an option of stopping the charging process when the battery gets to a certain number of percent.The weight reduction in the new version is almost similar to an old version. Since I lightly modified the whole case of my old G703 to honeycomb style and got it to eight five grams, personally, I do not feel any significant difference between almost hundred eight and almost ninety eight grams. From my point of view, there are many unnecessary parts inside the case of the mouse, which can be easily removed for a smoother and lighter feel. The main weight reduction in the new version is not only from a smaller battery, but also from a smaller/thinner PCB. The old PCB’s weight is around fourteen-fifteen grams, while the new PCB is somewhere between ten-eleven grams.As with an old version, both side buttons and front buttons have a palpable free space between the micro switch and buttons’ plastic hump, which touches the stem of the switch. Because of that, there is a potential increase in latency. After I replaced Chinese Omron micro switches to TTC gold micro switches in the old version, the space between the micro switch and buttons’ plastic hump is almost non-existent. Perhaps the solution to this issue are micro switches with either longer stems or bigger case height than on Chinese Omron switches.The sensor itself works as great as the old PMW3366. I did not notice any lags/jitters while I was using it in four different competitive FPS titles. The only difference is that it is less power hungry than PMW3366.The new version of G703 was released in 2019, but for some reason, Logitech still uses USB micro B port instead of USB type C to this day. It feels like Logitech purchased several trucks full of these USB micro B ports and since the money was already spent, they just need to use them until they are completely gone.The battery life is much better than the old version. I use the mouse without any LEDs, on three thousand two hundred DPI and on thousand Hertz polling rate for four to six hours a day. I try to charge the battery to eighty percent whenever it drops to thirty percent. The seven hundred fifty mAh battery in the old version needs to be recharged every third day, while the two hundred forty mAh battery in the new version stays strong for almost two weeks without any charge.Overall, the shape of the mouse and the mouse itself are great, but it feels like this version is what the old G703 was supposed to be. I hope that Logitech either release the better version of G703 or a better variation of an ergonomic mouse."}

I mostly use it for work, and it's equally comfortable in my hand and easier on my wrist because it's so much lighter and easier to move. It doesn't have side scrolling, but I mapped the thumb buttons to scroll, and it works great. Also, clicking the scroll wheel enables scroll-based-on-offset mode which is great for scrolling (either vertically or horizontally) without needing to keep scrolling the wheel or pressing the button. Also, it's now much easier to drag things exactly one pixel for graphics work, which I didn't realize was previously frustrating until it started being easy with this mouse. Overall very useable for work.For gaming, this mouse is a huge step up. I mostly play StarCraft 2, and since getting the new mouse my accuracy is way better - I didn't realize how slow I had to move before to make sure I was clicking the right thing! It really feels like my hand suddenly got more coordinated. I don't do FPS much anymore, but I imagine it would make a big difference there too. Not a ton of buttons, so maybe not great for RPGs where you want to map a ton of things. But the core point-and-click experience is really great."}

The mouse's feet/skates looked like somebody took the mouse for a test drive before putting it back inside a box. The sides of the scroll wheel looked shabby, as if somebody was scratching them with long nails.The software support of the new and the old versions are like night and day. The new version works only with infamous G Hub software, while the old version can work with either G Hub or Logitech Gaming software. While both software programs are horrible and unnecessary in their own unique ways, The Gaming software lets you at least turn off LEDs. That is right; G Hub does not have an option of turning off LEDs on the wireless mouse, which has a limited battery life. The only way to do that is through on board memory configurator, which is like a small .exe file, which lets you configure your mouse without installing any kind of manufacturers’ software/bloatware. Another good point in Gaming software is that it has a notification for when the battery drops to 30 percent of battery life, which is quite useful for prolonging the battery’s factory lifespan. G Hub has that too, but for some reason, it malfunctions from time to time. The only thing I would have added is an option of stopping the charging process when the battery gets to a certain number of percent.The weight reduction in the new version is almost similar to an old version.

Battery life is decent even with the RGB on, I get 3-5 days/charge with heavily varying hours of use. I knocked off a star because the best implementation is to have a switch on the bottom for the RGB lighting in my opinion. But, that's my only issue with it. The best way to use a high DPI mouse is to crank up the DPI on the mouse and lower it far down in the games and stuff you're using. That way, you have a lot of precision. The Teflon feet slide around almost effortlessly on my mousepad, and it's also very quiet to move around. It can handle being mad and slammed on a bit, just mind the scrollwheel because that is a failure point if dropped.Overall, it's nicely weighted, and clicky."}

I was thoroughly impressed with the mouse that I purchased. However, 6 months after using this mouse, the scroll wheel malfunctioned. At first, it wasn't that big of a deal, but it progressively became more irritating and frustrating because the scroll wheel wanted to work on its own time. Trying to scroll down would result in the page scrolling up SOMETIMES, or it just wouldn't work. Then there are also moments when the scroll wheel moves down on its own without me touching or using it. It became so annoying that I decided enough is enough and purchased a new mouse. If the scroll wheel hadn't malfunctioned, this would have been the best gaming mouse I have ever purchased. Unfortunately, I don't know if I'll ever purchase another Logitech mouse because of the issue with this scroll wheel.Pros:1. Exceptional for gaming2. Has weights on the mouse that you can adjust to your own liking3. Feels comfortable to hold/Isn't too big for people with smaller/medium-sized hands.4. The wireless battery life lasts for A WHILE (the longest it's lasted for me was 2 1/2 weeks)Cons:1. Scroll wheel decided to give out on me 6 months in.2. Adding on to the scroll wheel bit: Even when trying not to use the scroll wheel, it would work on its own and randomly scroll up or down without me touching it. So it affected gameplay a lot of the time."}

I had taken all the items out of the packaging and did not see the weight.  Then I looked online and saw several answers that made it sound like you had to purchase the weight separately and it was not included.  A couple of the answers were marked as from Logitech so I presumed it was correct and wrote a scathing review.But I happened to think, \"no.  I've purchased many a Logitech product and this did not seem right.\"  I checked the packaging again and tucked into the place where the wireless dongle had been was the weight.  It must have been hidden under it and was well wedged into place.So if you're like me and you want that extra weight in your mouse, re-examine your packaging.  This weight does indeed come with the mouse and tucks nicely under the compartment under the mouse that's secured by a cover using a couple of magnets.Only time will tell if this product holds up but so far I've enjoyed it.

I get 0 double clicks error.Also the logitech software on PC has been updated and I have 0 issues with it as mentioned on some of the reviews on here. Also the range and disconnecting issue I have not encountered them ( PRO TIP: USE the cable extension that it came with as this acts as an antenna extender and place the USB dongle away from your PC, metal, or any electronics that can cause interference. Also make sure to separate from other wireless dongles IE: Logitech G915 Wreless).As for its size and ergonomics, it is very comfortable to use.  I have very small hands and it's comfortable for me. It's works great for palm gripper of ypu have small hands.Old review:I was very skeptical about purchasing this but It's been 3 weeks and NO double click issue that people are reporting on other reviews. Very light and premium build. It uses the same Hero sensor as the more expensive G pro  for a lot cheaper price. It's ergonomic and it's perfect for palm grip. Other grip style works well IF YOU HAVE BIG HANDS. For smaller hands palm grip works well. RGB is nice without over doing it. The material they use are premium and there is rubber pad grips on the sides to help slippage. The left/right and side button clicks are one of the best feeling in the market. The wheel scroll is also very good. Unfortunately there is no infinite scroll but it's NOT deal breaker what so ever. ONE of the best gaming mouse I've used and it's very sleek looking. Other gaming mouse looks over done with a transformer look to it, which I hate. Lots of good review on YT"}

I am glad to say I finally was able to change that. This was the upgrade I needed. I have been using this for about 2-3 months as of now. It's created a clear improvement in my gaming and everyday experience.In terms of gaming I mainly play fps. For the most part I am pretty good at them, expect for Valorant. Well, not any more. Sure I have spent some time training in the practice range, but I have to say I saw a significant difference in my performance when I switched mouses.Another game which has been impacted is TeamFight Tactics and League of legends. Although they are the polar opposite of a shooter the mouse has given me the right amount of precision. It was slight, but I used to have an issue where sometimes it felt like I was clicking a little bit away from where I wanted to click. This mouse has solved any precision issues I've had.The only flaw that I've really had with this mouse is the placement of the dpi- button. Maybe my hands are too big or I just move my hand around a lot, but sometimes I click it on accident without noticing. its not a huge issue and I notice it pretty quickly, but it had happened 4 or five times already.In terms of battery not many comments to add. It lasts a really really long time. I have it on and use it pretty much every day for about 6-7 hours and it keeps going for a long time. It usually lasts like two weeks before needing charge."}

{"asin": "B088539GLT", "username": "Ryan", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed Review", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2021", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackSize: XXLStyle: Mat", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The Razer BlackWidow is one of the most iconic gaming keyboards of all time. It’s undergone numerous revisions over the years but today’s release marks new territory for the series with a new 65-percent compact form factor. If you found the ultra-compact Huntsman Mini too small but still like the idea of saving space on your desktop, this is a keyboard you won’t want to miss.If you’re coming from a full-size keyboard, expect a short learning curve. The V3 Mini doesn’t feature a function row and continues to hide less-used functions on secondary layers. This also applies to media controls and macros. To aid the learning curve, a number of the keys have side legends so you won’t need to guess what they do when pressed with Fn. These aren’t backlit, however, so you can’t see them in the dark.As a HyperSpeed product, the BlackWidow uses Razer’s latest wireless gaming technology to deliver wired-like performance without the need for a cord. This is the same tech found on some of the company’s premier wireless peripherals like the Orochi V2, one of our best gaming mice of 2021, and BlackWidow V3 Pro. Gone are the days of wireless peripherals lagging behind their wired counterparts. The BlackWidow V3 Mini was just as responsive whether it was connected over USB or with the 2.4GHz dongle.The new dongle has another trick up its sleeve: multi-device support. If you also happen to use a compatible Razer HyperSpeed mouse, you can pair it to the dongle inside Synapse and control both with a single USB port. This doesn’t apply to all HyperSpeed products yet (my Basilisk Ultimate wouldn’t work), but if you happen to own an Orochi V2, DeathAdder V2 Pro, or Naga Pro, you can store that dongle back in its compartment.Given its size and relatively steep price, you might want to take it on the go and the V3 Mini is ready to connect in any scenario. In addition to HyperSpeed wireless, it also features Bluetooth and wired USB support. Bluetooth has noticeably more latency than HyperSpeed or wired, so isn’t the ideal choice for gaming. Instead, I used it to quickly switch my laptop and desktop. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to use the bluetooth connection when charging, which is disappointing. I also wish there were a key combination to enter bluetooth mode instead of being forced to flip the switch on the back. First world problems, but when up and coming brands like Epomaker make swapping modes easier, it stands out.Despite multiple connection options, the V3 Mini sports an impressive battery life up to 200 hours. That’s a best case scenario with backlighting disabled and drops substantially depending on your lighting settings. Unlike some wireless keyboards, the Mini doesn’t cap the brightness of the backlight when wireless. At 100% brightness battery life drops all the way to 17 hours on spectrum cycling mode. Cut that brightness to 30% and it jumps back up to 48 hours. If you do happen to run dry, plugging in for 30 minutes will recharge the keyboard to 50% to get you back in the game quickly.Like the BlackWidow V3 Pro, the Mini HyperSpeed uses Razer’s doubleshot ABS keycaps (PBT is reserved for the Huntsman line) and your choice of clicky green or linear yellow Razer-branded switches. I was able to briefly test both versions but settled on the yellow switches. Razer’s new yellow switches feature internal dampers to cut down on key noise, so you won’t need to worry about bothering others around you. They’re also a speed switch. With an actuation force of 45 grams, they’re similar to Cherry MX Reds but trigger at 1.2mm instead of 2.0mm. That’s 40-percent faster and you can feel that sensitivity. My first day with the keyboard was frustratingly typo-filled until I got used to the lighter touch it requires.The keycaps are great and do an effective job of showing off the RGB. The legends are crisp and high-quality without the gamery feel and lettering gaps found on cheaper sets. They’re also much thicker than standard gaming keycaps and feel solid under the finger. Since they’re ABS, they will shine over time, but Razer has applied a light texture to their surface to ward off early wear and tear and to hide finger oils.Since this is a Razer gaming keyboard, you can look forward to all manner of programmability through its Synapse software. Of course, you have total control of the per-key RGB backlighting through a selection of good-looking presets or can customize or sync your own lighting animations through the Photoshop-esque Chroma Studio module. If you’d rather not use the software, the preset options are also stored on the keyboard’s memory, though avoiding Synapse will drastically reduce your customization options. No matter which you go with, it’s sure to be an eye-catching display of light and color thanks to the floating key design which exposes the translucent switch housings.The software also allows you to customize the layout of the keyboard with custom remaps, shortcuts, and macros. There are three onboard memory profiles to store settings for individual games, which is especially useful given the already compact layout. Creating your own keymaps is easy and intuitive thanks to key recording and an array of preset options for features like Windows shortcuts.Synapse has come a long way over the last several years and is well worth spending time with, but I still wish the BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed were not so dependent on it. For example, “on the fly” macro recording simply won’t work without it. Likewise, even though the keyboard is capable of producing 16 million colors, you can only choose between six for the three customizable presets built into the board. This simply pales in comparison to keyboards like the Ducky One 2 SF which has a similar form factor and doesn’t require software at all despite costing far less.Thanks to its small size and excellent connectivity, the BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed makes for an excellent travel keyboard. Over the course of my testing, I used it at work during the day and took it home for gaming at night. I had to send the clicky switch version back after two days, so the bulk of my testing was done using the Razer Yellow switches.Right off the bat, the Razer Yellow switches were a joy to type on. They’re smoother than Cherry MX Red, don’t have any spring noise, and feature internal sound damping to cut down on noise. They’re quiet enough to use in an office and softer to bottom out without feeling mushy. My first day was full of typos due to their increased sensitivity but by the time I got home to play games, I was used to the lighter touch they required. These are switches that will trigger simply from resting your fingers too heavily, but I found that actually taught me to bottom out less and made the keyboard even quieter to use.On the other hand, the larger keys were much louder than the rest due to poorly lubed stabilizers. Razer did apply a small amount but it wasn’t enough and there didn’t seem to be any in other places generating rattle, really defeating the purpose of the silenced switches on these keys. The backspace and spacebar were the worst offenders. I was able to fix this by adding some additional lube myself, but given how good the stabilizers have been on some of Razer’s other recent keyboards, and how expensive this board is, it really shouldn’t have been necessary.With both gaming and work, the 65-percent form factor was excellent. For navigating spreadsheets, word documents, and even browsing social media, the additional arrow and navigation keys were a godsend. 60-percent keyboards usually require advanced customization to make them fully and easily functional in these contexts. The Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini was easy to use, right out of the box, no programming required.Gaming with it was also easy and fun. Since it’s only one column wider than a 60-percent and roughly two columns narrower than a TKL, I was able to keep my hands closer together which made PC gaming more comfortable. Having the right-side keys double as macro buttons was also useful in World of Warcraft and let me keep my hands on the movement keys even when firing them off. Aesthetically, the smaller keyboard also fit right into with my PC gaming setup and looked clean due to the lack of wires.Dual-mode connectivity was useful but has room for improvement. I found myself switching between 2.4GHz and bluetooth regularly to work, game, or chat between my laptop and my desktop. Swapping connections is fast with only a couple seconds of delay but needing to flip a switch every time got old fast. HyperSpeed was reliably excellent no matter what game I was playing but bluetooth would occasionally feel sluggish with noticeable latency. Infrequently, it would miss keystrokes as if the connection had momentarily gone to sleep. It was usable but not something I wouldn’t attempt to game with."}

{"asin": "B08D27XXRY", "username": "Eric Peterson", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nNaga Pro brings positives of Naga Trinity to a wireless mode", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020", "purchased": "Size: MouseStyle: Naga Pro", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "TL;DR - I've been waiting for a new wireless version of the Naga for some time now. As a multi-genre gamer that mainly plays MMOs but occasionally dabbles in other genres like shooters, the Trinity concept is perfect. The Naga Pro feels like slightly upgraded and wireless available version of an already great mouse. If you're a fan of the original Naga Trinity or looking for a great all-around wireless gaming mouse with a large number of buttons, the Naga Pro comes as a strong recommendation.Longer version: I've always liked the general feel of the Naga mouse - not too big, not too small, relatively ergonomic to my average if not slightly smaller hand size for a guy. I've been using the mouse and its different versions since the OG back in 2009, and my favorite version was the 2014 Epic Chroma that also had a wireless option. Since then, Naga mice haven't supported wireless. That's unfortunate as I like the clean desk look of a wireless mouse, and get annoyed by the \"tug\" of the cable despite trying some gadgets that try to wrangle cables in the ideal positions. The downside for wireless, purportedly, is the delay versus wired mouse. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference. It feels instantaneous to me. Wired vs Wireless is only something that matters to professional gamers, when every tiny detail gives an edge over the competition. But for 99% of gamers out there, your skill is going to define your performance/ranking far more than something like a minuscule amount of delay on your mouse. Suffice to say, it's not going to turn your game around enough to choose wired over wireless if you generally prefer wireless. Razer touts its \"Hyperspeed\" wireless - I don't know how much of that is just marketing nonsense. To my feeling, the responsiveness at least compares to my Logitech G305, which I use for my setup in my living room with my nVIDIA Shield.Now I'll ramble a bit about Naga as a product line. I've gone through like 6 different Naga mouse over the years - none of them broke; they've all performed great. I only upgraded them because of wanting features, or because they  were getting too grimy after many hours of use (which as an MMO gamer, they have gotten many hundreds of hours of mileage). Firstly, if you're generally in the market for a MMO mouse and looking at the different options out there, I think the Naga has always been the best. I've tried some of the others out there from Corsair and Logitech. They're decent products, but ultimately the thing that has me coming back is the physical ergonomics of the Naga. I love the shape of the mouse, and the 12 buttons are easy to differentiate from each other by the individual button contours. It doesn't even need \"bumps\" to help you train your muscle memory (which would eventually erode over time, trust me). The only downside is that I feel like the last three buttons (10, 11, and 12) are difficult to hit without hand strain, but this may be because of my smaller sized hand and getting older.That being said, 1 through 9 is still some great button real estate. As far as playing MMOs, I consider the Naga (or a similar mouse) essential. I honestly don't know how I used to play without them. You can use them as additional button binds, or you can replicate your number keys to give your hands some different options to hit the same keys (which I do to overcome hand strain from long hours of play). If you've never tried a mouse like this and aren't sure if it's worth it  - it is. The only challenge is the initial learning curve. It took me several weeks to really get used to using the mouse, but once I did, there was no going back. It helps so much in raiding, for example, when you might need to be running around with WASD while also hitting a complex button rotation. Doing this is night and day between having a Naga and not having a Naga.Now, I'll zero in on the Naga Pro. This only just came out, so I can't review it for things like battery longevity. That being said, Razer's not new to the PC product game, so I have nor reason to doubt in its technical specifications for the charge time. Out of the box, the mouse does feel very similar to the Trinity, if not exactly the same. The shape is the same, the side button contours are the same, and the materials seem the same. The materials I think are perhaps the only slight downfall of the product - it has a bit of a plasticy feel to it; I wish the product felt more solid. That being said, the light weight does help in situations like FPS gaming, when you need to move the mouse quickly. For a chunkier sized mouse, it's not a bad weight. But if you solely game FPS, the Naga would be hard to recommend. There are lighter mice out there, and you might want to consider something wired. That being said, if you are just a casual FPS gamer, or playing something like Borderlands, the Naga works just fine, if not outstanding with the additional button potential. The hot-swappable left panel is one of the coolest innovations in gaming mice tech I've seen in years. It works instantly and without a hitch. It snaps in place magnetically - it feels solid and never like it's a weird attachment.Speaking about the additional buttons, that's another thing that's changed over the Trinity. The hot-swappable left panel has gotten rid of one panel in exchange for another. Instead of the \"circular\" button layout designed for MOBAs (which tbh I never used, even as someone who occasionally plays MOBAs), there is a more condensed 1-6 button layout. It's kind of a nice option for people who play MMOs with fewer keybinds like Guild Wars 2, or someone who can't reach all 12 buttons. I see this as an improvement over the Trinity, as I never used the circular button layout and could potentially use the 1-6 grid layout.Long story short (too late), so far, I think the Naga Pro is great. It maintains the greatness of the Trinity product and brings in to a wireless version. If you liked the Trinity, you will like the Naga Pro. If you did not like the Trinity, you will not like the Naga Pro. If you're new in the market for a MMO mouse, I recommend trying it out. Be gentle with it though and leave yourself the option to return if you don't like it. Some people complain about the scroll wheel, but I've never had an issue there. Suffice to say, mice are personal and subjective peripherals, and things like shape and ergonomics differ in preference from person to person. This might not be the mouse for you. But as a concept, it's executed well and one of the best on market. The final downside is the price - it's on the expensive side. But for me, input is how you interact with your game - it's the connection between you and what's happening in-game. It's worth investing in as a core part of your setup."}

As a passionate gamer, this mouse has taken my gameplay to a whole new level of control, versatility, and precision.First and foremost, I have to mention the wireless functionality of the Naga Pro. It’s absolutely seamless and reliable. The 2.4GHz HyperSpeed wireless technology ensures a super-fast and lag-free connection, giving me the freedom to move around without any restrictions. I’m impressed with how responsive it is; it feels just as good as using a wired gaming mouse. With no worries about input delay, it creates an immersive and enjoyable gaming environment.One of the standout features of the Naga Pro is its modular design. I love how the side plates are interchangeable, allowing me to customize the mouse to match different game genres and playstyles. Whether I’m playing an MMO and need the classic 12-button layout, diving into a MOBA with a 6-button configuration, or engaging in FPS games with a clean and minimalistic layout, this mouse has got me covered. The magnetic attachment system is a breeze to use, and it keeps the side plates securely in place during intense gaming sessions.Speaking of buttons, the Naga Pro has mechanical switches that feel amazing to click. They’re tactile, responsive, and consistent. Each click provides a satisfying feedback that adds to the overall gaming experience. The button placement is well-thought-out and easily accessible, enabling quick and seamless execution of complex commands. It’s also worth mentioning that the ability to assign macros and remap buttons using Razer Synapse software adds an extra layer of customization, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs.The Naga Pro’s 20,000 DPI Focus+ optical sensor is a beast in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. It offers flawless tracking, even during the most intense and fast-paced gaming moments. Being able to customize the DPI settings allows me to fine-tune the mouse’s sensitivity to match my preferences perfectly. This ensures precise aiming and pixel-perfect accuracy, which is a significant advantage, especially in competitive gaming.Comfort is key during long gaming sessions, and the Naga Pro delivers in that department. The ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly, providing a comfortable and natural grip. The mouse glides smoothly across different surfaces, thanks to its PTFE feet, reducing fatigue and giving me better control. The build quality is exceptional, too, with a sturdy construction that feels durable and reliable.Last but not least, let’s talk about battery life. The Naga Pro impresses with its long-lasting battery. I can enjoy up to 150 hours of uninterrupted gaming on a single charge, which means I rarely have to reach for the charging cable. Plus, the included charging dock makes it incredibly convenient to keep the mouse charged when I’m not using it. The fact that I can continue gaming while it’s charging is a testament to the versatility and convenience of this fantastic gaming mouse.In conclusion, the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is an absolute must-have for gamers who are serious about their gameplay. Its wireless capabilities, modular design, precise tracking, and ergonomic feel make it a powerhouse in the gaming world. With the Naga Pro, you can unleash your gaming potential and elevate your gameplay to new heights!Disclaimer: I received no compensation or incentives for writing this review. I genuinely believe in the quality and performance of the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse."}

My mind has been COMPLETELY changed! even being on the low end price wise for a good mouse this thing packs a punch. It's got a nice braided cable that doesn't look like it's going to wear out in a few months. its got a finger rest on the side which is GREAT for someone like me with larger hands. without the rest my ring and pinkie fingers would always get fatigued just dragging beside the mouse but no more! It's also got the simple to use keypad to use with your thumb on the side which has not only made gaming easier, it has also upped productivity when doing other work as you can program all 12 buttons to do different things all to your liking. Lastly you've got the chroma lighting that can also be VASTLY customized. best part is that it mostly plug and play but you will be asked to install Razer software which isn't a problem because it's needed to customize the mouse. Overall this has been the best mouse I have used in my experience with computers over the years."}

Really enjoy the lighting customization with a Razor keyboard as well as the ability to customize the adjustable DPI on the mouse.Only issue myself and others have consistently ran into is that every once in a while the mouse will either fail to recognize the side button presses or will fail to recognize the side completely. In the early stages of this disease you can remove the panel and put it back on, clean the pins, or push the panel into the mouse, but once it progresses enough you either have to get a new mouse or send it into Razor to have it fixed / replaced.

Switching between the three is easy too.-Often on sale and not too different from the Naga Pro 2, but much cheaper-Uses Synapse 3, so it will be supported for quite a while Cons:-Side buttons are very sensitive (this could also be a pro, depending on the user)-The left and right clicks are somewhat heavy and seem to take a bit more effort to push down-Louder clicks than some options out there-Still not the cheapest option out there"}

The Naga is my favorite because of its shape. I have rather large hands and long fingers, and the way this mouse sits in my palm is pretty much perfect. Very ergonomic and solid grip. Sure, DeathAdder as well as Mamba are also very comfortable, but there's something special about having this heavy & big mouse, with the arching bulge, under my palm. I feel very much in control of its movement and, actually, appreciate its weight. It's precise and customizable enough for my needs. The three RGB zones may be lacking to some, but, really, it all comes down to how comfortable a mouse feels and not how it looks.I like its clicky somewhat stiffer buttons. The main buttons take a bit of effort to actuate than the buttons on DeathAdder or Mamba but I like that feeling. There are less accidental miss-clicks. Perhaps a professional CS:GO player would appreciate the light weight and sensitivity of DeathAdder, but I, just a casual gamer that plays a lot of story-driven FPS and RPGs, really dig the Naga. Sure, the sensor it has can't be as fine-tuned with the software as the one in the DeathAdder, but this aspect has 0 difference to me personally.  And don't get me wrong, the sensor it has is very good, probably the same hardware, in fact, that goes up to 16000 DPI -- it just can't be as minutely adjusted by software as on some of other Razer mice. I use stock presets. Low sensitivity for FPS, higher sensitivity for RTS, etc. The stock sensitivity options are plenty sufficient to me but can be modified to some extent by the Synapse.I am sure a lot of people would seek this mouse not for its shape but for the fact that it has three panels for the left side with various button layouts. I do find that having the extra buttons is nice and I've been learning to utilize them more. It feels awesome having all 12 of my most used spells in WoW being accessible by the thumb. It does take a bit of practice to get good with those buttons but it's really worth it, especially when it comes to PVP. The fact that you don't have to use the panel with 12 buttons if you don't want to, and could have a panel with 7 or 3 -- is very nifty. Certain titles might work better with the lesser number of buttons and switching them on the go is effortless. It really is like having three mice in one. Others noted that the replaceable panels feel very solid and I will note that too. There's no give or any kind of rattling. They sit in secured by magnets the way that you can't even tell that they are replaceable. I think that's certainly a big win for the design.I can't comment on the reliability or how long this mouse would last. I see a lot of negative comments from people that complain of the buttons' failure. I haven't experienced any of this yet, though I haven't used this mouse for a long time. My other two Razer mice -- the DeathAdder Elite and the Mamba Elite -- have no issues. The DeathAdder is nearly 5 years old since I purchased it. It sill runs strong and there's only mild wear, for the most part it still looks like new. Sure, Naga is a very different model than the other two and it may behave differently, but so far Razer got a very good, nearly excellent, track-record with me. Otherwise I wouldn't purchase this mouse in the first place.The three RGB zones may put some people away but to me it doesn't matter. I don't stare at my mouse when I play and the comfort of use is way more important than the pretty lights. The Mamba Elite has some very extensive RGB to it and I have it plugged in for the pretty effects (starlight looks awesome on its sides!), and it's more of a display piece now on my desk than my daily driver. The Naga, on the other hand, has become the daily driver that I very much enjoy using. I wish I bought it as my first Razer mouse, so that by now I would have been a pro with the extra buttons!"}

As a long time WoW player since original TBC, I have used every mouse you can think of. When MMO mouses came out and I made the switch to using them, I have tried them all. I settled on the Naga Trinity which I have been using now for the last few years. Do they last long? Not really. I think I have been through around 4 or 5 Trinitys since I have used them. Either a side button stops working when pressed and doesn't register everytime or the scroll wheel gets really notchy and hard to use which I use alot. My last 2 Trinitys were bad scroll wheels. When playing I use scroll wheel up/down/click with shift modifiers whether it's arena targeting or other class abilities. Also the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel I remap to ALT and Shift so I can hold that button down and use a key on my keyboard for a bind.I decided to try the Naga X this time recommend by a rank 1 glad player and it's nothing but amazing and an improvement over the Trinity IMO. It's noticeably lighter by a lot. Doesn't it feel sort of like cheap plastic? Yes, but I could care less. That's why it is light. I noticed the razer symbol on the back of the mouse doesn't light up like it does on the Trinity. I could care less, hand is covering that part of the mouse anyways. That's probably also why it lighter. Does the X have interchangeable side panels for the amount of buttons you want on the side? No, that's why I'm buying an MMO mouse so that's not important to me. If I wanted a mouse with 2 or 6 buttons than I'd be buying something else. Just a marketing thing in my eyes for the Trinity to give people more options. The PTFE feet seem to glide better and feel smoother. The speed flex cable on the X is amazing compared to the stiff Trinity cable, another plus. I've never been a fan of wireless mice like the Naga Pro for example. I don't ever want to worry about battery life or my mouse to stop working. It's like wireless internet compared to wired. An ethernet connection is much more secure and something less to worry about as with anything wired. A mouse is no different. The side buttons feel the same between the two, nice light click and responsive. The scroll wheel on the X beats the Trinity hands down. The reason is because the Trinity has tilt left/right and the X does not. That tilt left/right causes the scroll wheel to feel loose overtime and with my experience causes the gear in the scroll wheel to get notchy and cause scrolling problems. I never used tilt scroll wheel so it's not important to me. The scroll wheel on the X is solid and smooth as butter. No tilt left/right but nice solid smooth scroll up/down/click. The X only has one big button behind the scroll wheel which I remaped to ALT. For some reason I find hitting that 1 big button easier than the 2 buttons on the Trinity. I can live without a 2nd button, didn't really use it tbh. Can't miss it or fat finger a second button. Not really sure what else to say other than I'd highly recommend giving the X a shot if what I've listed is important to you. Time will tell now how the X holds up compared to the Trinity overtime but the Naga X is my new go to mouse. Going to buy another as a backup because they are on sale and I can buy 2 for the price of 1 Trinity."}
{"asin": "B08D27XXRY", "username": "Eric Peterson", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nNaga Pro brings positives of Naga Trinity to a wireless mode", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020", "purchased": "Size: MouseStyle: Naga Pro", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "TL;DR - I've been waiting for a new wireless version of the Naga for some time now. As a multi-genre gamer that mainly plays MMOs but occasionally dabbles in other genres like shooters, the Trinity concept is perfect. The Naga Pro feels like slightly upgraded and wireless available version of an already great mouse. If you're a fan of the original Naga Trinity or looking for a great all-around wireless gaming mouse with a large number of buttons, the Naga Pro comes as a strong recommendation.Longer version: I've always liked the general feel of the Naga mouse - not too big, not too small, relatively ergonomic to my average if not slightly smaller hand size for a guy. I've been using the mouse and its different versions since the OG back in 2009, and my favorite version was the 2014 Epic Chroma that also had a wireless option. Since then, Naga mice haven't supported wireless. That's unfortunate as I like the clean desk look of a wireless mouse, and get annoyed by the \"tug\" of the cable despite trying some gadgets that try to wrangle cables in the ideal positions. The downside for wireless, purportedly, is the delay versus wired mouse. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference. It feels instantaneous to me. Wired vs Wireless is only something that matters to professional gamers, when every tiny detail gives an edge over the competition. But for 99% of gamers out there, your skill is going to define your performance/ranking far more than something like a minuscule amount of delay on your mouse. Suffice to say, it's not going to turn your game around enough to choose wired over wireless if you generally prefer wireless. Razer touts its \"Hyperspeed\" wireless - I don't know how much of that is just marketing nonsense. To my feeling, the responsiveness at least compares to my Logitech G305, which I use for my setup in my living room with my nVIDIA Shield.Now I'll ramble a bit about Naga as a product line. I've gone through like 6 different Naga mouse over the years - none of them broke; they've all performed great. I only upgraded them because of wanting features, or because they  were getting too grimy after many hours of use (which as an MMO gamer, they have gotten many hundreds of hours of mileage). Firstly, if you're generally in the market for a MMO mouse and looking at the different options out there, I think the Naga has always been the best. I've tried some of the others out there from Corsair and Logitech. They're decent products, but ultimately the thing that has me coming back is the physical ergonomics of the Naga. I love the shape of the mouse, and the 12 buttons are easy to differentiate from each other by the individual button contours. It doesn't even need \"bumps\" to help you train your muscle memory (which would eventually erode over time, trust me). The only downside is that I feel like the last three buttons (10, 11, and 12) are difficult to hit without hand strain, but this may be because of my smaller sized hand and getting older.That being said, 1 through 9 is still some great button real estate. As far as playing MMOs, I consider the Naga (or a similar mouse) essential. I honestly don't know how I used to play without them. You can use them as additional button binds, or you can replicate your number keys to give your hands some different options to hit the same keys (which I do to overcome hand strain from long hours of play). If you've never tried a mouse like this and aren't sure if it's worth it  - it is. The only challenge is the initial learning curve. It took me several weeks to really get used to using the mouse, but once I did, there was no going back. It helps so much in raiding, for example, when you might need to be running around with WASD while also hitting a complex button rotation. Doing this is night and day between having a Naga and not having a Naga.Now, I'll zero in on the Naga Pro. This only just came out, so I can't review it for things like battery longevity. That being said, Razer's not new to the PC product game, so I have nor reason to doubt in its technical specifications for the charge time. Out of the box, the mouse does feel very similar to the Trinity, if not exactly the same. The shape is the same, the side button contours are the same, and the materials seem the same. The materials I think are perhaps the only slight downfall of the product - it has a bit of a plasticy feel to it; I wish the product felt more solid. That being said, the light weight does help in situations like FPS gaming, when you need to move the mouse quickly. For a chunkier sized mouse, it's not a bad weight. But if you solely game FPS, the Naga would be hard to recommend. There are lighter mice out there, and you might want to consider something wired. That being said, if you are just a casual FPS gamer, or playing something like Borderlands, the Naga works just fine, if not outstanding with the additional button potential. The hot-swappable left panel is one of the coolest innovations in gaming mice tech I've seen in years. It works instantly and without a hitch. It snaps in place magnetically - it feels solid and never like it's a weird attachment.Speaking about the additional buttons, that's another thing that's changed over the Trinity. The hot-swappable left panel has gotten rid of one panel in exchange for another. Instead of the \"circular\" button layout designed for MOBAs (which tbh I never used, even as someone who occasionally plays MOBAs), there is a more condensed 1-6 button layout. It's kind of a nice option for people who play MMOs with fewer keybinds like Guild Wars 2, or someone who can't reach all 12 buttons. I see this as an improvement over the Trinity, as I never used the circular button layout and could potentially use the 1-6 grid layout.Long story short (too late), so far, I think the Naga Pro is great. It maintains the greatness of the Trinity product and brings in to a wireless version. If you liked the Trinity, you will like the Naga Pro. If you did not like the Trinity, you will not like the Naga Pro. If you're new in the market for a MMO mouse, I recommend trying it out. Be gentle with it though and leave yourself the option to return if you don't like it. Some people complain about the scroll wheel, but I've never had an issue there. Suffice to say, mice are personal and subjective peripherals, and things like shape and ergonomics differ in preference from person to person. This might not be the mouse for you. But as a concept, it's executed well and one of the best on market. The final downside is the price - it's on the expensive side. But for me, input is how you interact with your game - it's the connection between you and what's happening in-game. It's worth investing in as a core part of your setup."}

As a passionate gamer, this mouse has taken my gameplay to a whole new level of control, versatility, and precision.First and foremost, I have to mention the wireless functionality of the Naga Pro. It’s absolutely seamless and reliable. The 2.4GHz HyperSpeed wireless technology ensures a super-fast and lag-free connection, giving me the freedom to move around without any restrictions. I’m impressed with how responsive it is; it feels just as good as using a wired gaming mouse. With no worries about input delay, it creates an immersive and enjoyable gaming environment.One of the standout features of the Naga Pro is its modular design. I love how the side plates are interchangeable, allowing me to customize the mouse to match different game genres and playstyles. Whether I’m playing an MMO and need the classic 12-button layout, diving into a MOBA with a 6-button configuration, or engaging in FPS games with a clean and minimalistic layout, this mouse has got me covered. The magnetic attachment system is a breeze to use, and it keeps the side plates securely in place during intense gaming sessions.Speaking of buttons, the Naga Pro has mechanical switches that feel amazing to click. They’re tactile, responsive, and consistent. Each click provides a satisfying feedback that adds to the overall gaming experience. The button placement is well-thought-out and easily accessible, enabling quick and seamless execution of complex commands. It’s also worth mentioning that the ability to assign macros and remap buttons using Razer Synapse software adds an extra layer of customization, allowing me to tailor the mouse to my specific needs.The Naga Pro’s 20,000 DPI Focus+ optical sensor is a beast in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. It offers flawless tracking, even during the most intense and fast-paced gaming moments. Being able to customize the DPI settings allows me to fine-tune the mouse’s sensitivity to match my preferences perfectly. This ensures precise aiming and pixel-perfect accuracy, which is a significant advantage, especially in competitive gaming.Comfort is key during long gaming sessions, and the Naga Pro delivers in that department. The ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly, providing a comfortable and natural grip. The mouse glides smoothly across different surfaces, thanks to its PTFE feet, reducing fatigue and giving me better control. The build quality is exceptional, too, with a sturdy construction that feels durable and reliable.Last but not least, let’s talk about battery life. The Naga Pro impresses with its long-lasting battery. I can enjoy up to 150 hours of uninterrupted gaming on a single charge, which means I rarely have to reach for the charging cable. Plus, the included charging dock makes it incredibly convenient to keep the mouse charged when I’m not using it. The fact that I can continue gaming while it’s charging is a testament to the versatility and convenience of this fantastic gaming mouse.In conclusion, the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is an absolute must-have for gamers who are serious about their gameplay. Its wireless capabilities, modular design, precise tracking, and ergonomic feel make it a powerhouse in the gaming world. With the Naga Pro, you can unleash your gaming potential and elevate your gameplay to new heights!Disclaimer: I received no compensation or incentives for writing this review. I genuinely believe in the quality and performance of the Razer Naga Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse."}

My mind has been COMPLETELY changed! even being on the low end price wise for a good mouse this thing packs a punch. It's got a nice braided cable that doesn't look like it's going to wear out in a few months. its got a finger rest on the side which is GREAT for someone like me with larger hands. without the rest my ring and pinkie fingers would always get fatigued just dragging beside the mouse but no more! It's also got the simple to use keypad to use with your thumb on the side which has not only made gaming easier, it has also upped productivity when doing other work as you can program all 12 buttons to do different things all to your liking. Lastly you've got the chroma lighting that can also be VASTLY customized. best part is that it mostly plug and play but you will be asked to install Razer software which isn't a problem because it's needed to customize the mouse. Overall this has been the best mouse I have used in my experience with computers over the years."}

Really enjoy the lighting customization with a Razor keyboard as well as the ability to customize the adjustable DPI on the mouse.Only issue myself and others have consistently ran into is that every once in a while the mouse will either fail to recognize the side button presses or will fail to recognize the side completely. In the early stages of this disease you can remove the panel and put it back on, clean the pins, or push the panel into the mouse, but once it progresses enough you either have to get a new mouse or send it into Razor to have it fixed / replaced.

As a long time WoW player since original TBC, I have used every mouse you can think of. When MMO mouses came out and I made the switch to using them, I have tried them all. I settled on the Naga Trinity which I have been using now for the last few years. Do they last long? Not really. I think I have been through around 4 or 5 Trinitys since I have used them. Either a side button stops working when pressed and doesn't register everytime or the scroll wheel gets really notchy and hard to use which I use alot. My last 2 Trinitys were bad scroll wheels. When playing I use scroll wheel up/down/click with shift modifiers whether it's arena targeting or other class abilities. Also the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel I remap to ALT and Shift so I can hold that button down and use a key on my keyboard for a bind.I decided to try the Naga X this time recommend by a rank 1 glad player and it's nothing but amazing and an improvement over the Trinity IMO. It's noticeably lighter by a lot. Doesn't it feel sort of like cheap plastic? Yes, but I could care less. That's why it is light. I noticed the razer symbol on the back of the mouse doesn't light up like it does on the Trinity. I could care less, hand is covering that part of the mouse anyways. That's probably also why it lighter. Does the X have interchangeable side panels for the amount of buttons you want on the side? No, that's why I'm buying an MMO mouse so that's not important to me. If I wanted a mouse with 2 or 6 buttons than I'd be buying something else. Just a marketing thing in my eyes for the Trinity to give people more options. The PTFE feet seem to glide better and feel smoother. The speed flex cable on the X is amazing compared to the stiff Trinity cable, another plus. I've never been a fan of wireless mice like the Naga Pro for example. I don't ever want to worry about battery life or my mouse to stop working. It's like wireless internet compared to wired. An ethernet connection is much more secure and something less to worry about as with anything wired. A mouse is no different. The side buttons feel the same between the two, nice light click and responsive. The scroll wheel on the X beats the Trinity hands down. The reason is because the Trinity has tilt left/right and the X does not. That tilt left/right causes the scroll wheel to feel loose overtime and with my experience causes the gear in the scroll wheel to get notchy and cause scrolling problems. I never used tilt scroll wheel so it's not important to me. The scroll wheel on the X is solid and smooth as butter. No tilt left/right but nice solid smooth scroll up/down/click. The X only has one big button behind the scroll wheel which I remaped to ALT. For some reason I find hitting that 1 big button easier than the 2 buttons on the Trinity. I can live without a 2nd button, didn't really use it tbh. Can't miss it or fat finger a second button. Not really sure what else to say other than I'd highly recommend giving the X a shot if what I've listed is important to you. Time will tell now how the X holds up compared to the Trinity overtime but the Naga X is my new go to mouse. Going to buy another as a backup because they are on sale and I can buy 2 for the price of 1 Trinity."}

I'm fastidious about mouse accuracy because I'm an artist. Yes, I use a drawing tablet with a pen, but some things are just better done with a mouse. The best thing about this mouse is it works so reliably, way better than the Anker Wireless I ditched for this one. Even though they mentioned the drag free cord in the description, I've never actually seen one, so I didn't expect much of anything different, but it's really pretty slick, and I expect it will catch on eventually for all mice. As for the buttons, this is my first mouse with that many extra buttons (I bought my first mouse in 1982). Some examples would have been nice in the instruction set up, but it actually was pretty simple to set up, I've set up 6 so far. I'm finding I need to be a little more careful in handling the mouse, because I keep accidentally triggering 2, which I have set up to launch Windows Explorer, but I'm sure that will come with time. I've used Razer products before even though I am NOT a gamer, and known them to be good reliable products although pricey for us non-gamers. I recently purchased a Razer keyboard and was pleasantly surprised that that finally ended my keyboard frustrations, so I thought I'd tackle my mouse frustrations next, looks like this one is a definite keeper! That old cliché \"you get what you pay for\" is definitely true when it comes to Razer mice and keyboards."}

{"asin": "B08D27XXRY", "username": "Cipher 8", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nTop mouse for any MMO/MOBA/Gaming enthusiast", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020", "purchased": "Size: MouseStyle: Naga Trinity", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "A little background as a purchaser/reviewer of products:Having owned a RΛZΞR mouse since the original Naga was introduced until it got worn out from usage and then I had to get a Hex v2 to replace it because you couldn't buy the old naga anymore. Now I got the Naga Trinity. A quick wiki search tells me there have been nine iterations in the Naga series, not counting the redesigned versions and I must say I have never not liked one of my MMO/MOBA mice from RΛZΞR. And I'm not one of them gamer lifestyle junkies or uber Razer fanboys that goes out and buys everything chroma and wears their clothing or nothing. In fact, I actually own plenty of varying brands across my gaming peripherals including Corsair, Logitech, etc. I just like Razers products when it comes to their M+K options. Mice specifically being reviwed here, because they are quality and I trust them as one of the premier gaming hardware manufacturing companies. There are many of these brands out there for PC to choose from these days but Razer is right at the top IMHO..The mouse:After years of using the original Naga, then Hex v2, and now Naga Trinity I got use to  this style of mouse configuration and how the ergonomics or placement of your hand sits on them. It rests a little differently so you might feel awkward at first but trust me you will get use to it with repitition in no time.I liked to keep my muscle memory the same so when my original Naga wore out I looked for another. I ended up going with Hex v2 because the Naga had been phased out with the emergence of popular MOBA's they redesigned it a little bit. I was reluctant to buy that one because i wanted my 12 buttons in 3x4 pattern not the circular 7 buttons. But I got use to it and it sufficed until the Trinity was released.Once the Trinity came out it gives you the best of all worlds really. You can swap out the side button options to what you prefer or need for any specific game you want to play. Or any program you wanna use your mouse with (non-gaming).Which brings me to my next point in Razer mice. They have top notch lasers in them, very accurate. While the implications for gaming are obvious here just as a everyday mouse for anyone using a PC they are worthy of a purchase. They last a long time. Tons of clicks and scrolls on the scroll wheel before they wear down and need to be replaced. Talking years of usage. And I'm a heavy PC user. Not just for games either. Once you use it awhile the tactile feel of the mouse scroll does go away but everything functions fine still. I actually prefer getting them worn in tbh.Lastly, I'm one of the people who actually has no gripes about their hardware configuration tool Synapse. It works flawlessly for me and wasn't that hard to learn either. The tool offers a lot of customization for what each button on the mouse does what even letting you keybind a custom function like Shift+Q to a single button press if you wanna get complex. Also want to point out that on the bottom of this mouse there is a button that quickly swaps profiles so you can set up a profile for each game you are playing. or some MMO games you play different class/job so you can have a different profile and have the buttons do something else on each. Customizing and keybinding to your hearts desire really. Then of course the Synapse has the DPI options and the superfluous stuff like lighting options which is nice and I get why they include it but not wholly needed.All in all you won't be disappointed by this mouse. No matter if you play MMO's/MOBA's/Shooters/or don't game at all. I almost bought two just because i know when it wears out years down the road I'm just going to want to replace it with another one."}

{"asin": "B08D27XXRY", "username": "Reason", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nThis is a solid mouse if you can get one that doesn't have misclicking issues", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2020", "purchased": "Size: MouseStyle: Naga Trinity", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "This mouse is one of the more expensive gaming mice available. You buy something like this (as opposed to just a regular old mouse) when you want some extra buttons on your mouse compared to a more basic one and want to have more control over exactly what your mouse does. Although this mouse is plug-n-play, you can (and should) download the software that pairs with it so you can customize it to your needs. This includes changing what the buttons do, changing the lighting (or removing it entirely if you prefer), and changing the sensitivity.Recently I tried two top gaming mice, the Corsair Nightsword and this Razer Naga Trinity. I first got the Naga Trinity and would have stayed with it but I had some double-clicking issues when it first arrived. Sometimes when I tried to click things or select text, it would do an extra click or not click at all, which was quite frustrating. I had no choice but to either replace it or try a different mouse, and I opted for the latter.Before I continue, do note that I have pretty large hands (8.25\" from middle finger tip to the crease on my wrist, 4\" across the widest part of my palm (across the knuckles), and nearly 10\" from my thumb tip to my pinky tip when my hands are open wide as if I were trying to palm a basketball) and I use a fintertip style grip (see pictures) on my mouse — your own hand size and grip style will determine whether each of these mice is a good fit for you.Here is what I like and dislike about each, with points from -3 to +3 next to each point which indicate how much I like or dislike each feature (-3 being very much dislike, +3 being very much like):Corsair Nightsword:A. [+3] it has two additional buttons to click on top (gives more top button options for gaming, the Razer only has extra side buttons)B. [+1] it has more protection for the thumb (although my thumb doesn't really drag on the mousepad without it, it's a nice touch)C. [+1] DPI level can be seen from the side of the mouse (rather than the normal which I feel like is by the center top of the mouse which you can't see when your hand is there), a the mouse changes color when you press it to make the change even more salientD. [+0.5] Aesthetically looks better than the Razer Naga in my opinionE. [-1] Middle mouse wheel requires a bit more force than I would like to click itF. [-3] (Dealbreaker for me) I can only reach 1 of the 3 side thumb buttons with my normal grip, despite the fact that I have large hands. I would need to convert to palm grip which is not really desirable as it's less precise with clicking.Razer Naga Trinity:A. [+3] Changeable side panels allow you to use the button setup you prefer, although I feel like the 12 button grid is a bit excessive and wish there was an option for a 6-button grid.B. [+3] The mouse wheel can be tilted left or right which is handy, they can be configured as extra buttonsC. [-3] The double-clicking / misclicking issue I described above. Strangely, it seems to occur much less now for no reason I can explain, but if it happens even one more time I'm going to have to replace the mouse. Note: My particular mouse might simply be defective, but other reviewers have said this is an issue for them as well so clearly there's some sort of quality control issue.For me, the 12-button side panel is great because the way I naturally use the mouse my thumb rests right in the center of all the buttons, making them all accessible if need-be (though pressing the middle buttons is a bit trickier, at least I can reach all of them whereas my partner with smaller hands cannot easily press all the buttons even if she wanted to).I'll probably stick with the Razer Naga trinity (and re-order a new one if the clicking issues persist) simply because the side buttons are difficult to reach for me with the Corsair Nightsword, but I hope I provided enough detail so you can make a more-informed decision for yourself. :)"}

It's well built, the texture isn't too smooth, and it's not as heavy as other \"MMO\" mice. It has a slightly rough texture that feels very comfortable in the hand. The feet on the mouse are virgin-grade PTFE, which is the best material available and allows for very smooth movement.The side panels hare held in place with 2 neodymium magnets. The magnets are strong enough to keep the panel firmly attached to the mouse (no wiggling at all), but are still easy to pry off whenever you want to swap panels.Only the 12-button side panel has RGB, and the entire panel counts as a single LED, so you unfortunately can't customize the LED color of individual buttons (but you can program their individual functions). Also, the buttons on this panel are angled a little weird, and they're a little too flexible. Remember when you were a child, and your teeth would slowly become \"loose\" before falling out? These buttons feel similar to loose teeth, although they feel fairly comfortable to use and work perfectly well for their intended purpose. I didn't have much issue with accidentally pressing them with my thumb.The 6-button and 2-button panels are a lot more convenient than the 12-button panel for most scenarios. They both have a section underneath the buttons where you can place your thumb to properly grip the mouse. And the buttons on these panels feel a lot more like regular mouse buttons. Just keep in mind that the body of the mouse only has 2 sections with RGB - the scroll wheel and Razer logo.One thing I noticed is that the \"Profile\" button underneath the mouse is actually customizable. It has all the same reprogramming options as the rest of the buttons on the mouse. Not sure what it might be useful for, but thought that it's an excellent improvement over previous Razer mice I've used, which didn't allow that button to be changed.As a final note, I'd like to add that even if you aren't interested in the RGB lighting (it can be completely disabled), I highly recommend this mouse, as well as Razer mice in general. It may seem like Razer products are sought after mainly for their extensive use of RGB, but it turns out they make very good quality mice. If you're looking for a mouse with a lot of extra buttons, the Naga Pro is what you want."}

The six button side panel isn't backlit like the twelve button panel.  The mouse wheel click action is also a bit wonky.  If you middle click a lot, like to paste text in Unix or to open browser links in new tabs, you may notice that it tends to scroll instead of click.Even with those gripes, if this device holds up after a couple years of usage, then I could say it is the perfect mouse.Edit: After several months, my right mouse button stopped working.  I disassembled and found that a small rubber boot that normally sits between the plastic of the mouse button and the switch itself came off.  The result was that you really had to mash the button down hard to register a click.  I replaced the missing boot with three layers of electrical tape and got the button working again.

I have gone through quite a few gaming mice and have become a bit picky. Most recently, I had a Razer Basilisk quit on me after only 3 months and the batteries in my RedDragon are starting to lose the ability to hold a charge. I debated for a long time on whether to bite the bullet and get a REALLY good mouse(i.e expensive, like the Logitech G PowerPlay solution) or to just get another RedDragon(because I really liked the ergonomics and rechargeable battery). But after browsing, I came across this mouse that had surprisingly good reviews for something half the price of a Basilisk, and a 4th the price of my RedDragon.  I ended up ordering 2 of these mice, one for my gaming rig and one for work, and am not disappointed in the slightest. I've only used it for the past few days but I would put its quality and overall usability for gaming up there with my much more expensive RedDragon. I'd rate it HIGHER than the Razer Basilisk. Its the perfect size, I have big hands but it doesn't feel too small or too narrow(like the Basilisk). Its light, and has these great perforated holes along both sides to allow airflow, which keeps my hand from getting too sweaty and slipping. It has multiple DPI settings which is nice, but the thing I like the most that I haven't had on any gaming mouse I've ever owned? The Silent Clicking. The listing for this device does not play up this feature enough. The primary Left and Right buttons have some sort of dampener or different kind of switch underneath that barely utters a sound when you click the buttons. Overall, pending any crazy failure in the immediate future, I can comfortably say this is probably the best overall gaming mouse I've ever owned hands down, and the insanely low price makes it even more amazing!"}

I've gone through 3 AA batteries in 4 months on this mouse, which is crazy considering my wireless logitech gaming mouse probably uses 1 battery in a year.

Lots of others have talked about its virtues and I agree with those soI'll focus on my problem.The mouse's polling rate is set by default at 500 Hz. You really do not need it that high. The lowest setting is 125 Hz and that should be default. The problem with having it higher is that it makes your computer very noisy. It'll emit loud sounds whenever you move the mouse if the polling rate is set too high. Depending on your system this may not even get through and it won't matter. On mine it did. The default absolutely should be 125 Hz with the higher settings being an option if people want them. Most people are not going to understand that the reason they're hearing loud noises is the setting is too high.You can change it with the configuration software that's on the mini CD included with the mouse or from the manufacturer's, Easterntimes Tech PC, website.

Lots of others have talked about its virtues and I agree with those soI'll focus on my problem.The mouse's polling rate is set by default at 500 Hz. You really do not need it that high. The lowest setting is 125 Hz and that should be default. The problem with having it higher is that it makes your computer very noisy. It'll emit loud sounds whenever you move the mouse if the polling rate is set too high. Depending on your system this may not even get through and it won't matter. On mine it did. The default absolutely should be 125 Hz with the higher settings being an option if people want them. Most people are not going to understand that the reason they're hearing loud noises is the setting is too high.You can change it with the configuration software that's on the mini CD included with the mouse or from the manufacturer's, Easterntimes Tech PC, website. You want the T7 driver setup."}

I use it for heavy duty gaming and have only had one failure in over 5 years, where one of the main buttons eventually got stuck.  Now I keep a few of these in my spare parts drawer, so that i always have one on hand when ever anyone in the family needs to replace any of their mice too.  This mouse has good feel, excellent responsiveness, can take thousands of clicks with no problem, and is a joy to use.  Highly recommended, especially for the price!"}

Wonderful sensitivity, but maybe not the best match for me and my needs personally. I'll keep getting used to it and see. I've yet to explore the programability. I'm considering disabling these side buttons if possible. I WISH the mouse making industry would just give us simple models like this, but with the thumb buttons on the other side. But NO, they insist on selling us huge awkward vertical contraptions, as if we were alien freaks that need special equipment. LOL  Lefties beware! ;)"}

I had a regular G Pro Wireless for about a year before I upgraded to the G pro wireless superlight. I immediately purchased these feet to go along with it as I had them for about 6 months on my regular g pro. The main complaint I've seen from others is that they wear quickly and aren't as slippery as when you first get them. However, the amount of friction they gain isn't significant to me. They definitely wear down as compared to when you first receive them, but not by much. I still love the ones on my regular g pro but the superlight was what I originally wanted. I could justify the superlight back then since it was 90 for the regular but 150 for the superlight. The superlight went on sale this Black Friday for $110 and I picked it up. I'd say the upgrade is definitely worth it since this mouse feels much more balanced in the hands. The feet are off a bit but probably less than a milimeter around. Kinda sloppy for $25 feet but I'd still say it's worth it. I'd definitely buy them again. I'm using the feet with the corsair mp510 mousepad and it offers excellent fluidity and great control.

Mouse glide is completely preferential.Most of the reviews on here will talk about how the skates are too fast and give them a 1 star rating, but that's exactly what the skates are supposed to do, they are designed to be super smooth on your mouse pad.But at roughly $30 for a pair, they are worth a shot. When I first installed them on my G Pro X Superlight (which was super easy to do, you literally just drop them into place and push them into the mouse for a few seconds) I instantly noticed how much smoother the glide was on the mouse. I played a few games on Apex Legends, Valorant, and CS:GO and noticed a pretty significant improvement on my aim (the main issue I was experiencing before the skates, was that my mouse would hang on the mouse pad and would cause my aim to be jittery.)There is a pretty slight caveat for the skates though, but its mainly for FPS games, if you tend to panic under pressure and click your mouse too hard, you will move your reticle when you click, or if your aim isn't steady and you tend to shake a little when you shoot, you will notice it a lot. The reason is because these skates remove a lot of the friction between the mouse and the mouse pad. Without that friction, any movement from your hand will be picked up by the sensor.I really like them, and I even bought a second pair just in case these slow down after a few months of use. Since some mouse skate companies tend to fall off after a while if their sales dont do too great."}

I had a regular G Pro Wireless for about a year before I upgraded to the G pro wireless superlight. I immediately purchased these feet to go along with it as I had them for about 6 months on my regular g pro. The main complaint I've seen from others is that they wear quickly and aren't as slippery as when you first get them. However, the amount of friction they gain isn't significant to me. They definitely wear down as compared to when you first receive them, but not by much. I still love the ones on my regular g pro but the superlight was what I originally wanted. I could justify the superlight back then since it was 90 for the regular but 150 for the superlight. The superlight went on sale this Black Friday for $110 and I picked it up. I'd say the upgrade is definitely worth it since this mouse feels much more balanced in the hands. The feet are off a bit but probably less than a milimeter around. Kinda sloppy for $25 feet but I'd still say it's worth it. I'd definitely buy them again. I'm using the feet with the corsair mp510 mousepad and it offers excellent fluidity and great control. When the feet are brand new it's so slippery it may be difficult to double click, so I'd say I'm okay with a bit of wear increasing the friction over time."}

I Also chose it because it has a few extra buttons on top (aside from the usual 2 side buttons).  I like to bind the extra buttons on top of the mouse for some in-game functions instead of using my keyboard.the mouse is a bit heavier than the current crop of super light weight mice, but it's still way lot lighter than my old G602 that had batteries in it.  it has a built-in battery, so that keeps the weight down.  battery life seems pretty decent so far.  I usually am online only for a few hours a day, and it's lasted a couple weeks and I have yet to charge it.  it will also work in wired mode, so you can use it while it charges.  it has 2 \"on\" modes: one with the full RGB lighting, and one that is like ECO mode, that let's you run with no lights, or with minimal lighting.  both modes allow you to run 1000hz polling rates.The left and right buttons are a little stiffer than my Asus mouse, but it doesn't affect my gameplay at all, and it's only noticeable when going from one mouse to the other.  the other buttons on the mouse feel good and are on par with any other well known name-brand mouse.The software is very easy to use, and is simple and lightweight.  I wish more companies would make their mouse software like this.  it allows you to set profiles, change lighting, bind the buttons, and program macros.  then lets you save it all to the on-board mouse memory, and then you can close the software and never run it again.  There are multiple DPI settings you can set, and/or turn on or off completely, a page for lighting controls, macro programming, button assignments, polling rate, speed settings, etc.  Basically all the typical mouse settings you'd ever need.After matching the dpi to my other mouse, I can say this mouse performs just as well as many more expensive mice.  The only difference I could feel was this mouse wasn't quite as \"fast\" as my other one.  the mouse skates weren't as slick.  I didn't mind though, and I was still able to aim accurately and quickly.After a few days I noticed that there was some plastic pealing up on one of the mouse skates.

It is still going strong. The optical switches are still the most reliable and responsive switches I have ever used. Even after millions of clicks and hardcore daily usage, this thing is as reliable as the day I got it. I can count on it to make clicks exactly when I intended to, never double clicking and never false triggering. Gamers know just how important this is.Battery still easily lasts for 2 days with constant usage and RGB brightness at the default 30%. Aside from the textures on the sidegrips having been worn completely smooth where the tip of my thumb rests and some discoloration of the skates, you practically cannot tell that this mouse has ever been used.I did run into a bit of trouble with the middle click requiring harder presses to register at one point. However, all I had to do was bang the mouse a couple times on the side against my mousepad and blow on the scroll wheel with pressurized air, and it has been working normally again ever since. Truly, nothing can faze this mouse.Of course, I should address that during those 2 years, Razer has updated the Viper series. To put it bluntly, the Viper V2 Pro is not worth it at all unless you value a 16g lighter weight over absolutely everything, on a mouse that is already extremely light. The V2 Pro lacks tons of features including side buttons on both sides, docked charging, and RGB. It also has a smaller battery. With this original Razer Viper Ultimate practically being permanently on sale now (being a \"previous generation\" mouse), it just has too much value over the new Viper V2 Pro, making the decision a no-brainer.In 2023, this is still the greatest mouse I have ever used, hands down. I still find it extremely comfortable in my hands. And there is no greater feeling than to know that I can always rely on this mouse to do exactly what I want it to do, 100% of the time.Razer, you'll have to do WAY better than the Viper V2 Pro to beat this Viper Ultimate.(P.S., Synapse is still terrible. It has no problems switching profiles anymore, but now it will occasionally go crazy with the CPU usage.)_____________________________________________Original Review:To preface - I find it very difficult to find a mouse shape that is comfortable for me.  My hands are roughly 19x10 cm and I use a full palm grip. My favorite mouse in terms of comfort is the Corsair Nightsword, followed by the Corsair M65. I also owned the Razer Basilisk, which is comfortable at first, but starts to cramp my hand with extended use.I have long been searching for a proper wireless mouse with a good RELIABLE connection, rechargeability/good battery life, a reasonable price, and of course above all, a good shape. It's no secret that the Viper Ultimate and the G Pro Wireless have been hailed as the best wireless mice around, but the price always kept me away from giving them a shot. Plus, I had heard about double click issues with the G Pro and the shape looked too ambidextrous for me. The more contoured shape of the Viper Ultimate and its optical switches caught my eye more. So when Prime Day came around and I saw the mouse + dock combo at $89.99, I jumped at the opportunity. (I would definitely not recommend paying $150 or even $120 for any mouse, it just isn't worth it.)Shape: 9/10I was scared of this the most since very few mice are comfortable to me. But when I started using the mouse, it felt great, to my surprise. Sure, the hump is a lower than I would have preferred, but my hand can rest very naturally on it with no cramping or fatigue. The low profile and relative lack of contours on the side make it slightly hard to pick up without it feeling like it's slipping out of your hand, but the incredibly light weight certainly makes up for it a bit. I didn't give it a 10/10 because for me, it still isn't as comfortable as the Corsair Nightsword (which feels like it was practically molded for my hand). Overall though, very comfortable and I plan to use it as my main mouse.Buttons: 9/10The main buttons are a 10/10 for me (Left click, Right click, and Scroll Wheel/Middle Click). They feel crisp and snappy with just enough feedback. I can definitely notice the optical switches. Every click feels EXTREMELY fast and responsive, but not in an oversensitive type of way. I use a mechanical keyboard with optical switches, and that has held up very well with 0 misfires or double-presses, so I am hoping for the same from this mouse. Every one of my mice with standard mechanical switches has ended up double clicking after some time and having to get replaced. My only problem with this mouse's buttons are the side buttons. They are way too recessed in the mouse (almost flush with the body) and I would definitely prefer them to stick out a bit more. Aside from that the buttons are very well built, with 0 wobble and a nice click.Software: 3/10Sorry Razer, but synapse just sucks. (Take some notes from Corsair please).The profile switching for recognizing different programs is extremely slow, causes the mouse to freeze up for a few seconds, and can even \"crash\" the mouse and require it to be turned on and off again. Apparently some other uses said this is because Synapse literally uploads the new profile to the mouse every time you switch programs, which is a terrible design. There IS a workaround, made possible by the fact that this mouse has on-board storage. Store the profiles you are using on the mouse's on-board storage, and you can use it without a hitch. However, this is really no excuse for Synapse to suck as there are plenty of other Razer mice that do not have on-board storage.The other big problem with Synapse is that macros do not immediately stop after you release a button - they will continue playing to completion. This severely limits the number of applications where you would choose to use a macro as this makes it too unsafe to use in many situations.Wireless: 10/10 (With the workaround stated above)Great connectivity - extremely reliable and responsive, as long as you use the workaround for Synapse. Switching profiles without the workaround was the only time the mouse would ever hiccup/disconnect. With the work around, it is just as reliable as a wired connection. And when the mouse goes into \"sleep\" mode, I hardly notice a delay when I wake it up.Sensor: 10/10Great sensor, combined with the low weight and low-friction gliding feet the tracking is silky smooth. Lift off distance is extremely low as well and can be further adjusted in Synapse.Weight: 10/10Extremely light. Do I sometimes miss having a sniper button to lower my DPI? Sure. But do I need it with such a light mouse? Certainly not. Any small micro-movements are extremely easy to make and it requires little to no-effort to move this mouse.Battery Life: 10/10I've been using this mouse with the default setting of 33% RGB brightness, and when I'm actively using the mouse at the computer for the whole day (12+ hours), it barely goes down to 70%. For less intensive use, you might last a whole 5 days without charging, or even a whole week. If you turn off the RGB, you could go for even longer._____________________________________________Final remarks:While the shape doesn't quite reach the 10/10 comfort that the Corsair Nightsword is for me, it is still extremely comfortable at a 9/10. Had I not experienced the Nightsword, I might have rated this a 10/10. It is comfortable enough that, combined with being wireless and having optical switches, I am completely sold on it. It is now my new primary mouse.The buttons are great, and I have high hopes for the reliability of the optical switches as Razer is the mouse maker currently using them. Wireless connectivity and and battery life are amazing. Synapse is the only thing that sucks. Razer please fix the software - it's borderline a dealbreaker that makes me reluctant to ever consider Razer products. If you ever see this mouse on sale, I highly recommend it. Just don't ever pay more than $100 for a mouse unless it was signed by Bob Ross."}

This is hands down the best Razer mouse I've used so far and possibly the best mouse I've used as well.  I haven't been on the bandwagon for lighter and lighter weight mice.  Now I might have to jump on that train because the Viper Ultimate is so shockingly light I have a hard time believing that it still works.  Previously I had the Razer Taipan and perceptually it's about 2.5 times heavier.  The transition over has taken a bit of time to get used to but I do like it.  It does feel like you can rapidly change the direction the mouse is moving without much effort and it could lead to better performance playing shooters in particular.Both the Taipan and the Viper Ultimate have rubber grips on the sides of the mouse, and I think It's a really nice feature of both.  I've used wireless mice in the past, a Microsoft one that failed me several times in the heat of battle that used AAA batteries.  I was really unsure about using a wireless mouse again but I figured it was about time to try one again, possibly the technology has improved over the years and certainly it has.  I was tempted by the Razer Orochi v2 but I didn't want to be buying batteries over and over.  I think the Viper Ultimate is a bit better for my personal preferences and I really do like it.  I was watching some YouTube videos analyzing the latency differences between current wireless mice and wired mice.  For the first time I think wireless mice are so competitive with wired mice its there is no major reason to be using a wired mouse outside of cost.  The Razer Viper Ultimate is a great example of this.  There may be a valid argument that the Viper 8k has superior performance over the Viper Ultimate Wireless but the mice refresh rate is so far above what most monitors can display at 1000Hz pooling rate It doesn't feel like there is a major reason to be concerned about it.  Not only that but I've heard the processing required to keep track of the cursor at 8000Hz actually drops your in game frame rate by about 3-4 frames per second (depending on your hardware configuration of course).  I don't see the benefit of a 8000Hz pooling rate right now.  In the end I think it's a great time to transition to a wireless mouse if your interested in it and are able to afford it.I purchased the version of the Viper Ultimate which included the dock and I'm glad I did.  The dock has a magnet on it which makes far easier to rest the mouse on the dock in the correct position for it to charge and you really just don't have to think about dropping the mouse on the dock, the convenience is great.  My only complaint about the dock is that it's so light that sometimes I pull up on the mouse and the dock actually lifts off my desk because the magnet is strong enough to carry the weight of the dock for a few seconds before it drops.  I guess the engineers of the mouse decided to add a sticky pad on the bottom of the dock to help with this but I think this is a lame solution.  A weighted dock design would be far superior in my opinion and hopefully it will be included in a future release.  I don't like the thought of a sticky pad on my desk, it might make a gross sticky mess (which thankfully it hasn't) and possibly will become a hard dusty mass in a few years time anyway.  That's really my biggest complaint with the mouse/dock combo.A minor issue I have with the mouse itself is the Teflon feet.  I wish there was a larger Teflon pad at the back end of the mouse, or maybe two separate feet that are larger that covers that back end area a bit better.  In the past I've used mice for years and years on end before replacing them and the back end of the mouse get's the most feet pad wear (at least for me).  I feel like the Viper Ultimate may not last as long just because the back end feet are not significant enough and they are positioned far to the sides of the mouse, to the point I'll be lifting the mouse up off the mousepad surface and then setting it down, back down back end first and dragging the plastic of the mouse on the plastic mousepad surface for a few moments before the Teflon feet make contact with the mousepad.  This is not ideal in my opinion.Razer synapse, I personally don't mind running software in the background for peripherals as long as it doesn't take up too many system resources and Synapse doesn't.  I HATE the way one has to log into an account to make use of some of the features.  No mouse should require one to create an account to make full use of a mouse, that is a garbage idea for user convenience.  I personally think convenience should be prioritized over most aspects of a products design and this causes me anger every time the synapse software asks me for the password that I usually have forgotten in the weeks that go by where I don't have to enter the password.  Even if I tell it to remember my password the Synapse software still asks me for my password from time to time (I think when it does an update).  It's difficult for me to put into words how rage inducing this is, mostly because it feels so unnecessary.  The software should remember your password no matter what, #1 and #2 you should not need to create an account to make use of mouse software, It's trash on two fronts.  Okay, Razer is a business and they feel like they require minor tracking of their customer base so they can make better business decisions and satisfy customers.  I don't like it at all but hypothetically I can understand.  Message to Razer: Make the Synapse software remember your log in info no matter what.  This software design is just as important as your hardware design work.  For over half of the use of my Razer Taipan I didn't use Synapse at all because it was such a pain in the rear end to make sure I'm logged in all the time.  This may indeed only be an issue with the older version of Synapse, so far I haven't had this issue since purchasing the Viper Ultimate.  I really hope Razer has resolved this and I no longer will be plagued with login requests.In the end very few products are perfect and it is hard to fault the Viper Ultimate Wireless with very much.  I think it's a product worth buying and I'm glad I purchased it, I hope it will last me a few years and be a valuable part of my gaming hardware arsenal.  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing this mouse, I wouldn't hesitate too much, its pretty awesome overall.  It is a bit more pricy compared to some wired options but I do prefer wireless over a corded mouse even with a cord bungie (which are really great by the way).  Definitely consider the Viper Ultimate Wireless mouse if your in the market for a mouse, It's a great option in my opinion, despite my complaints."}

Featuring an incredibly comfortable and sleek ambidextrous design, the Viper Ultimate stands tall amongst its peers, offering one of the best gaming experiences you can have with a mouse.Razer designed the original wired Viper with a key feature set in mind – creating a light, fast, wickedly responsive and premium gaming mouse and the Viper Ultimate adds to that with the addition of wireless connectivity. Long gone are the days of wireless mice being shunned by gamers and only being reserved for travel or general purpose use, wireless mice now stand at the forefront of gaming with offerings from Razer, Corsair, Logitech, Steelseries and other major manufacturers as upgrades to their wired siblings.The Viper and Viper Ultimate offer an extremely comfortable shape and design that really shows how far Razer has come with their mouse design. Subtle comfort grooves in the buttons, crisp button presses, well-stepped mouse wheel, and extremely comfortable rubber sides really make the mouse feel premium. The Viper is ideal for medium to medium-large hands, offering comfortable grip options for both palm, claw, and hybrid grip styles. Fingertip grip is possible here, but not recommended as the mouse as a longer body that is not well suited to fingertip grip styles. Integrated firm rubber sides, textured matte plastic body, and super comfortable shape for left and right handed users really take the spotlight. The mouse has side buttons on both sides, but are cleverly designed so that you never have to worry about accidental presses on either side, and even if you are worried about still somehow hitting the side buttons on the opposite side of the mouse – it is a simple enough task to go into the software and disable them. The mouse is also extremely rigid and sturdy, having no flex or bowing at all, there is a slight rattle but I think it is either in the mouse wheel or lens of the sensor. Not sure though, but it is nothing to be worried about, pretty standard fare there, though I would like to see that eliminated in the future., Lighting is minimal, with the only RGB goodness being the classic Razer logo on the butt of the mouse being lit up, but the charging stand also has an RGB LED on its base and integrates seamlessly into the Razer Chroma ecosystem and works as expected.Ultra low latency, long battery life, and ditching the cable drag are great bullet points for any wireless mouse manufacturer to have – but only a few have managed to add “under 100g” to that list. Logitech launched their G Pro wireless last year with a surprising 78g weight that was lighter than most wired mice, and now that smaller, lighter mice are in – it was the perfect time for Razer to fire back. The Viper Ultimate weighs in at a shockingly light and nimble 74g (2.6 ounces), beating out everything but the Glorious Model O series, the Finalmouse UItralight 2, and the Coolermaster MM710. And at 74g, I would gladly give up my Finalmouse’s ultra-feathery light weight for a better shape and wireless capabilities. I’d also be shocked if we didn’t see an even lighter Viper out next year with the ever popular honey comb design and even lighter materials, I’m almost positive that they could get the weight below 50g with relative ease.So we have a masterful recipe for success here with a great weight and balance, wireless connectivity, and sleek design and shape, but what about the internals?I am glad to say that the inside of the Viper and Viper Ultimate are just as well designed as the outside. The sensor is the result of the partnership between PixArt and Razer, and what they’ve brought with the 3399 is an incredibly fast, accurate, top-of-the line optical sensor that is near flawless in its execution. While the reported resolution of the sensor goes up to a true 20,000 cpi – we all know that none of us will ever even come close to using that level of granularity given that the overwhelming majority of gamers use 2000 dpi or lower. But it is nice to know that the option is there – in the event that we have 20K displays. The bottom is equipped with pure 100% PTFE feet without any dye positioned at the corners of the mouse and around the sensor itself. The absence of the black dye means there is zero grittiness to the glide of the mouse when moving it, and rivals that of aftermarket mouse feet like Hyperglides. The only reason you’ll ever need to replace these feet is if they ever wear out, they’re as good as mouse feet get. The clicks are satisfying and tactile, offering an instant response due to their opto-electric nature. Speaking of which, the opto-electric switches are great! Because there are no actual contacts, the switches have an incredibly long lifespan, over 50 million clicks and are immune to double-clicking that their mechanical microswitch brethren are notorious for.Included with the mouse is a charging dock that functions both as a home for the wireless receiver if you so choose and as a convenient and fast way to charge the mouse when not in use. Simply plop the mouse on the dock when you walk away to get a drink or go to bed, it is as simple as that – not that you’ll need to do that very often. The Viper Ultimate sports a staggeringly impressive maximum battery life of 70+ hours on one charge, and can be charged from 0-80% in 90 minutes or less. The cable used to plug into the charging dock can be used to connect the mouse directly to the computer to be used in a wired state, if you for some reason should want to do that. It is very lightweight and flexible, only ever so slightly stiffer than the Viper wired cable. Let’s be real here though, if you’re buying a wireless mouse only to plug it in and use it wired, what are you doing?At $150, it might be a tough purchase for some – but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it. If you are looking for the absolute best wireless gaming mouse out there right now, the Viper Ultimate is it. There is little room for debate on whether or not the Viper Ultimate is the king of gaming mice in 2019. Ultimately though, the best mouse for you is the one that feels best in your hand. So many mice have top optical sensors and similar specs, that it comes down to personal preference in regards to the shape. For me, the Viper Ultimate shape fits my hands extraordinarily well, whereas the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 and Logitech G Pro wireless exist at opposite ends of comfort for me. The Ultralight 2 is too small for my hands, and the G Pro feels too much like a semi-circular plastic dome, but the Viper Ultimate is just right.If there’s anything I would consider changing it would be creating a honey-comb shell design that would further reduce the weight and possibly making the side buttons modular, similar to that of Logitech’s offerings so that if we so choose to could simply remove the side buttons for the side of the mouse that we are not using.Razer, 2019 is the year you came back hard. I love what you’re offering and I really hope 2020 brings as much if not more innovation to your future product lines. You guys are champions, once more."}

The switches are pretty much the entire reason I bought this mouse over other mice. I'M SO SICK OF THE DOUBLE CLICK ISSUE AND I'M PRAYING THIS FIXES IT. Happened to my original Naga, kept me from buying another Razer mouse but then it happened even worse to my Zowie EC2-A. They are about the same \"speed\" as normal switches. Latency isn't better or worse. You can test this online.+ This is my first wireless mouse and I'm pleased to say that wireless feels just as responsive  as wired mode. VERY nice to not have to deal with a wire anymore and not have any downsides.+ Good customization within Synapse such as button programming, lighting, power-saving mode threshold, custom DPI, lift-off distance, etc.+ Saving to onboard memory is great, as is having the option to log in to synapse as Guest.+ Different methods of using and charging the mouse is really nice.+ Feet are good. No issues and glide nicely on a QCK Heavy. Texture on the shell is good and grippy. I prefer this textured plastic over a rubber coating. Rubber sides feel good. Grippy and not mushy at all. Mouse wheel has good feedback and feels good to scroll (for now) and has a nice grippy texture. Side buttons and scroll wheel feel pretty good to click and the NORMAL ones aren't in the way (left side for right-handed, right side for left-handed). There's no play/travel distance on the side buttons like there is on some mice like my old EC2-A.+ Battery life seems good. Going to actually test it now on full charge with lighting off but so far it seems as-advertised, at least for the most part.- After leaving it charging all night through the direct connection and from maybe around 20%, Synapse only read a 97% charge. I restarted Synapse to see if it was reading wrong but it still read 97%. I placed it on the dock for a few minutes and it fully charged to 100%. Not sure what that's about but thought I'd mention it. Will test this more.- Unsure if it's just Windows 7 not playing nice with it, but when switching modes, the mouse sometimes doesn't allow me to interact with things outside of my online browser. For example,  I'll switch from wired to wireless mode and I'll be able to move my cursor and interact with my  browser but NOTHING else is interactable until I restart the Windows explorer process. I can't highlight icons, close or open programs, windows or anything. Very strange and really hope this won't be an ongoing issue.- Could be an issue on my end but Synapse doesn't recognize the mouse or dock on either of my USB 3.0 ports. ONLY when I use the wireless receiver by itself does it recognize the mouse in Synapse. If the receiver is in the dock or even if the wire is connected directly to the mouse, Synapse will not pick it up. I still have function but can't change any settings until I use a USB 2 port. Ports work fine with other hardware.- Just a few days in and, though still good, the mouse wheel has slightly lost some of it's  snappiness in it's scroll and the left and right clicks have developed a slight give. Somewhat  nitpicking here, but I would really hate it if the mouse felt like crap to use in just a few months.  For the price, this things should be rock solid for years and not develop that mushy cheapness.- Didn't think I would, but I constantly press the sidebuttons on the right side when I'm aiming (I use it in my right hand). I had to disable them through Synapse. Thankfully you can and then save the setting to internal  memory. Unfortunately, I can't use them now for other things if I wanted to, such as  volume control.- Some part of the Razer software (Razer Synapse Service Process) stays running even after you select \"Exit All Apps\" from the  tray icon. This happened with my old Razer Naga too. Normally, I wouldn't care THAT much, but this particular process KILLS fps in my games. I literally have to end the process or games stutter like crazy for some reason, or at least Overwatch does.- Really just personal opinion, but it'd be nice if Razer would make some smaller mice. Pretty much all of their mice are too big in one way or another for someone with smaller hands and depending on how you grip. This one is just a bit too long for me personally.Overall, I think if it lasts and the shell doesn't become mushy and creaky like it very well may with enough use, it's everything a competitive FPS player would ever need IF (big if) the mouse fits your hand well. Measure your hands and decide for yourself. Mine are roughly...H 7.25 inches x W 4.25 inches (H 18.415 cm x W 10.795 cm)3 finger width (index, middle, ring) =  2.125 inches (5.3975 cm)Middle finger + knuckle = 4 1/4 inches (10.795 cm)And I probably fall somewhere between claw and fingertip grip, probably leaning more towards fingertip.--------------------------------------------So far, for me, after less than one week with the mouse:Performance: 10/10Comfort: 6.5/10 (subjective and also still getting used to the shape so likely to go up, but hitting sidebuttons accidentally sucks - also my first ambidextrous)Feedback: 8.5/10 (this will get lower if the shell quality doesn't hold and the snappiness diminishes)Quality: 8/10 (mostly concerned about long-term quality here as left/right buttons already have some slight give/shake to them after a few days of use and the scroll doesn't feel like it's going to hold it's feeling of precision and snappiness in it's steps - otherwise though, pretty solid)Software: 7/10 (good options but a little too bloated - can thankfully choose which software you'd like to install)Value: 7/10 (I got it on sale for $120 but I think it's worth more around $100 - if it was perfect for my hand and grip, $120 would be kind of okay maybe, however twice the price of the wired is high enough - full price is simply too much and in the end, I might come to regret not just buying two $60 mice and a bungee)Currently, this mouse is hovering around an 8 or 8.5/10 for me. This is likely to go up to a 9 with use and as I get used to it's size and shape, just as long as quality and performance stays the same as it is now. Overall I commend Razer for innovating and listening to it's customers and I hope to enjoy this mouse with no issue for years to come."}

That should say how much I use my mouse, not counting how rough I am on my mice, such as when sliding & lifting them across my mouse-pad or the occasional accidental drop. This lead me to typically only buy Razer mice, because all of the other main brand mice usually break around the 5 month mark for me.This is not to mention my original Razer Deathadder V1 mouse lasted 7 years of VERY harsh daily use, and only failed because its scroll-wheel broke. (Abbreviating Deathadder to DA from now on)That's not to say I haven't had issues with Razer products, my first DA V2 lasted 1 week until both the left click and the scroll wheel started failing leading me to then use the other brand name mice; G502 Hero lasted 5 months, Corsair M55 lasted 2 weeks,and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste lasted 3 months.My next Razer product was a DA V2 pro and that one lasted 2 years, Which led me to buy this one after that one started not sensing right clicks.Issues:I had zero issues with it for 8 months, then, entirely out of random, started having weird issues with connectivity.  This started out with very minuscule connectivity issues, such as it waiting 30 seconds for my PC and Razer's software to start working properly to use the mouse when it gets turned on after being off for a while.This was annoying, but I didn't care too much about that since I could still do whatever I needed to do.But fast forward ~4 months and the issues have compounded a little bit and I get my connection cut off when playing games for a solid 4 seconds at a time, and at this point this is getting REALLY annoying to endure (This happens plugged in too).At this point I am also having issues with the mouse having a slowed reception & it being able to hold a charge for more than half a day. I used to be able to use it at it's highest pulling rate and low brightness of the LED for 5 days without charging.Positives:Very durable plastic, I have very little wear on the mouse besides a bit of wear on the left click plastic making it shiny instead of matte black.Very comfortable if you claw grip your mouse (Not comfortable if you palm the entire mouse).Very light and easy to move on a mouse-pad.Fairly priced, ~$60 is quite decent for this mouse.Lasted 10 Months until having some bigger issues (Most mice completely break around the 5th month for me).Scroll wheel is perfect, zero squeaking (like a Corsair M55) or aggressive rumble feeling (like a Logitech G502) and has a good rubberized texture to it (HyperX Pulsefire haste didn't have any great texturing).Great for putting into a schoolbag for college or for storing in a laptop case.Buttons and sensor are great and feel immaculate.Cons:Either the USB dongle, or the mouse itself is having issues cutting out and not working at random after close to a year of use. The same with sensitivity, it has definitely gone down for the sensor.Battery is now starting to have issues holding a charge.This is where I am currently at with this mouse, It has worked very well for what it is, but I may soon have to upgrade, due to the issues I am having.You will probably have a longer service life on your mouse though, especially if you are not rough on your electronics.I would 100% recommend this if you need it for a laptop and need it to be wireless, or have smaller hands that are not as fitting for a Razer Deathadder."}

If you play a song that some guy hit the bass drum once, the cursor is moving on you. I've been playing FPS games all of my life, but I can't get the flick down for this mouse; the lack of weight gives 0 feedback to your hand. You are basically reactionary to everything. By that, I mean move the mouse first, react to how the screen moves, then adjust accordingly. Hard to get muscle memory to something that delivers no feedback cause this things weighs as much as a penny.Battery Life, Charging and the Razer app were all good, no issues to report on that."}

It is still going strong. The optical switches are still the most reliable and responsive switches I have ever used. Even after millions of clicks and hardcore daily usage, this thing is as reliable as the day I got it. I can count on it to make clicks exactly when I intended to, never double clicking and never false triggering. Gamers know just how important this is.Battery still easily lasts for 2 days with constant usage and RGB brightness at the default 30%. Aside from the textures on the sidegrips having been worn completely smooth where the tip of my thumb rests and some discoloration of the skates, you practically cannot tell that this mouse has ever been used.I did run into a bit of trouble with the middle click requiring harder presses to register at one point. However, all I had to do was bang the mouse a couple times on the side against my mousepad and blow on the scroll wheel with pressurized air, and it has been working normally again ever since. Truly, nothing can faze this mouse.Of course, I should address that during those 2 years, Razer has updated the Viper series. To put it bluntly, the Viper V2 Pro is not worth it at all unless you value a 16g lighter weight over absolutely everything, on a mouse that is already extremely light. The V2 Pro lacks tons of features including side buttons on both sides, docked charging, and RGB. It also has a smaller battery. With this original Razer Viper Ultimate practically being permanently on sale now (being a \"previous generation\" mouse), it just has too much value over the new Viper V2 Pro, making the decision a no-brainer.In 2023, this is still the greatest mouse I have ever used, hands down. I still find it extremely comfortable in my hands. And there is no greater feeling than to know that I can always rely on this mouse to do exactly what I want it to do, 100% of the time.Razer, you'll have to do WAY better than the Viper V2 Pro to beat this Viper Ultimate.(P.S., Synapse is still terrible. It has no problems switching profiles anymore, but now it will occasionally go crazy with the CPU usage.)_____________________________________________Original Review:To preface - I find it very difficult to find a mouse shape that is comfortable for me.  My hands are roughly 19x10 cm and I use a full palm grip. My favorite mouse in terms of comfort is the Corsair Nightsword, followed by the Corsair M65. I also owned the Razer Basilisk, which is comfortable at first, but starts to cramp my hand with extended use.I have long been searching for a proper wireless mouse with a good RELIABLE connection, rechargeability/good battery life, a reasonable price, and of course above all, a good shape. It's no secret that the Viper Ultimate and the G Pro Wireless have been hailed as the best wireless mice around, but the price always kept me away from giving them a shot. Plus, I had heard about double click issues with the G Pro and the shape looked too ambidextrous for me. The more contoured shape of the Viper Ultimate and its optical switches caught my eye more. So when Prime Day came around and I saw the mouse + dock combo at $89.99, I jumped at the opportunity. (I would definitely not recommend paying $150 or even $120 for any mouse, it just isn't worth it.)Shape: 9/10I was scared of this the most since very few mice are comfortable to me. But when I started using the mouse, it felt great, to my surprise. Sure, the hump is a lower than I would have preferred, but my hand can rest very naturally on it with no cramping or fatigue. The low profile and relative lack of contours on the side make it slightly hard to pick up without it feeling like it's slipping out of your hand, but the incredibly light weight certainly makes up for it a bit. I didn't give it a 10/10 because for me, it still isn't as comfortable as the Corsair Nightsword (which feels like it was practically molded for my hand). Overall though, very comfortable and I plan to use it as my main mouse.Buttons: 9/10The main buttons are a 10/10 for me (Left click, Right click, and Scroll Wheel/Middle Click). They feel crisp and snappy with just enough feedback. I can definitely notice the optical switches. Every click feels EXTREMELY fast and responsive, but not in an oversensitive type of way. I use a mechanical keyboard with optical switches, and that has held up very well with 0 misfires or double-presses, so I am hoping for the same from this mouse. Every one of my mice with standard mechanical switches has ended up double clicking after some time and having to get replaced. My only problem with this mouse's buttons are the side buttons. They are way too recessed in the mouse (almost flush with the body) and I would definitely prefer them to stick out a bit more. Aside from that the buttons are very well built, with 0 wobble and a nice click.Software: 3/10Sorry Razer, but synapse just sucks. (Take some notes from Corsair please).The profile switching for recognizing different programs is extremely slow, causes the mouse to freeze up for a few seconds, and can even \"crash\" the mouse and require it to be turned on and off again. Apparently some other uses said this is because Synapse literally uploads the new profile to the mouse every time you switch programs, which is a terrible design. There IS a workaround, made possible by the fact that this mouse has on-board storage. Store the profiles you are using on the mouse's on-board storage, and you can use it without a hitch. However, this is really no excuse for Synapse to suck as there are plenty of other Razer mice that do not have on-board storage.The other big problem with Synapse is that macros do not immediately stop after you release a button - they will continue playing to completion. This severely limits the number of applications where you would choose to use a macro as this makes it too unsafe to use in many situations.Wireless: 10/10 (With the workaround stated above)Great connectivity - extremely reliable and responsive, as long as you use the workaround for Synapse. Switching profiles without the workaround was the only time the mouse would ever hiccup/disconnect. With the work around, it is just as reliable as a wired connection. And when the mouse goes into \"sleep\" mode, I hardly notice a delay when I wake it up.Sensor: 10/10Great sensor, combined with the low weight and low-friction gliding feet the tracking is silky smooth. Lift off distance is extremely low as well and can be further adjusted in Synapse.Weight: 10/10Extremely light. Do I sometimes miss having a sniper button to lower my DPI? Sure. But do I need it with such a light mouse? Certainly not. Any small micro-movements are extremely easy to make and it requires little to no-effort to move this mouse.Battery Life: 10/10I've been using this mouse with the default setting of 33% RGB brightness, and when I'm actively using the mouse at the computer for the whole day (12+ hours), it barely goes down to 70%. For less intensive use, you might last a whole 5 days without charging, or even a whole week. If you turn off the RGB, you could go for even longer._____________________________________________Final remarks:While the shape doesn't quite reach the 10/10 comfort that the Corsair Nightsword is for me, it is still extremely comfortable at a 9/10. Had I not experienced the Nightsword, I might have rated this a 10/10. It is comfortable enough that, combined with being wireless and having optical switches, I am completely sold on it. It is now my new primary mouse.The buttons are great, and I have high hopes for the reliability of the optical switches as Razer is the mouse maker currently using them. Wireless connectivity and and battery life are amazing. Synapse is the only thing that sucks. Razer please fix the software - it's borderline a dealbreaker that makes me reluctant to ever consider Razer products. If you ever see this mouse on sale, I highly recommend it. Just don't ever pay more than $100 for a mouse unless it was signed by Bob Ross."}

This is hands down the best Razer mouse I've used so far and possibly the best mouse I've used as well.  I haven't been on the bandwagon for lighter and lighter weight mice.  Now I might have to jump on that train because the Viper Ultimate is so shockingly light I have a hard time believing that it still works.  Previously I had the Razer Taipan and perceptually it's about 2.5 times heavier.  The transition over has taken a bit of time to get used to but I do like it.  It does feel like you can rapidly change the direction the mouse is moving without much effort and it could lead to better performance playing shooters in particular.Both the Taipan and the Viper Ultimate have rubber grips on the sides of the mouse, and I think It's a really nice feature of both.  I've used wireless mice in the past, a Microsoft one that failed me several times in the heat of battle that used AAA batteries.  I was really unsure about using a wireless mouse again but I figured it was about time to try one again, possibly the technology has improved over the years and certainly it has.  I was tempted by the Razer Orochi v2 but I didn't want to be buying batteries over and over.  I think the Viper Ultimate is a bit better for my personal preferences and I really do like it.  I was watching some YouTube videos analyzing the latency differences between current wireless mice and wired mice.  For the first time I think wireless mice are so competitive with wired mice its there is no major reason to be using a wired mouse outside of cost.  The Razer Viper Ultimate is a great example of this.  There may be a valid argument that the Viper 8k has superior performance over the Viper Ultimate Wireless but the mice refresh rate is so far above what most monitors can display at 1000Hz pooling rate It doesn't feel like there is a major reason to be concerned about it.  Not only that but I've heard the processing required to keep track of the cursor at 8000Hz actually drops your in game frame rate by about 3-4 frames per second (depending on your hardware configuration of course).  I don't see the benefit of a 8000Hz pooling rate right now.  In the end I think it's a great time to transition to a wireless mouse if your interested in it and are able to afford it.I purchased the version of the Viper Ultimate which included the dock and I'm glad I did.  The dock has a magnet on it which makes far easier to rest the mouse on the dock in the correct position for it to charge and you really just don't have to think about dropping the mouse on the dock, the convenience is great.  My only complaint about the dock is that it's so light that sometimes I pull up on the mouse and the dock actually lifts off my desk because the magnet is strong enough to carry the weight of the dock for a few seconds before it drops.  I guess the engineers of the mouse decided to add a sticky pad on the bottom of the dock to help with this but I think this is a lame solution.  A weighted dock design would be far superior in my opinion and hopefully it will be included in a future release.  I don't like the thought of a sticky pad on my desk, it might make a gross sticky mess (which thankfully it hasn't) and possibly will become a hard dusty mass in a few years time anyway.  That's really my biggest complaint with the mouse/dock combo.A minor issue I have with the mouse itself is the Teflon feet.  I wish there was a larger Teflon pad at the back end of the mouse, or maybe two separate feet that are larger that covers that back end area a bit better.  In the past I've used mice for years and years on end before replacing them and the back end of the mouse get's the most feet pad wear (at least for me).  I feel like the Viper Ultimate may not last as long just because the back end feet are not significant enough and they are positioned far to the sides of the mouse, to the point I'll be lifting the mouse up off the mousepad surface and then setting it down, back down back end first and dragging the plastic of the mouse on the plastic mousepad surface for a few moments before the Teflon feet make contact with the mousepad.  This is not ideal in my opinion.Razer synapse, I personally don't mind running software in the background for peripherals as long as it doesn't take up too many system resources and Synapse doesn't.  I HATE the way one has to log into an account to make use of some of the features.  No mouse should require one to create an account to make full use of a mouse, that is a garbage idea for user convenience.  I personally think convenience should be prioritized over most aspects of a products design and this causes me anger every time the synapse software asks me for the password that I usually have forgotten in the weeks that go by where I don't have to enter the password.  Even if I tell it to remember my password the Synapse software still asks me for my password from time to time (I think when it does an update).  It's difficult for me to put into words how rage inducing this is, mostly because it feels so unnecessary.  The software should remember your password no matter what, #1 and #2 you should not need to create an account to make use of mouse software, It's trash on two fronts.  Okay, Razer is a business and they feel like they require minor tracking of their customer base so they can make better business decisions and satisfy customers.  I don't like it at all but hypothetically I can understand.  Message to Razer: Make the Synapse software remember your log in info no matter what.  This software design is just as important as your hardware design work.  For over half of the use of my Razer Taipan I didn't use Synapse at all because it was such a pain in the rear end to make sure I'm logged in all the time.  This may indeed only be an issue with the older version of Synapse, so far I haven't had this issue since purchasing the Viper Ultimate.  I really hope Razer has resolved this and I no longer will be plagued with login requests.In the end very few products are perfect and it is hard to fault the Viper Ultimate Wireless with very much.  I think it's a product worth buying and I'm glad I purchased it, I hope it will last me a few years and be a valuable part of my gaming hardware arsenal.  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing this mouse, I wouldn't hesitate too much, its pretty awesome overall.  It is a bit more pricy compared to some wired options but I do prefer wireless over a corded mouse even with a cord bungie (which are really great by the way).  Definitely consider the Viper Ultimate Wireless mouse if your in the market for a mouse, It's a great option in my opinion, despite my complaints."}
{"asin": "B07YPC3BQC", "username": "David D.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer Viper Ultimate - No Snake Oil Here, the new King of Mice", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2019", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackStyle: Mouse + Dock", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Razer Viper Ultimate ReviewThis has been a killer year for Razer in their product lineup. From keypads, to keyboards, and now mice as well. The Viper Ultimate is Razer’s one-two punch answer to the Logitech G Pro wireless, which is now getting on over a year old, and it is quite the response. Featuring an incredibly comfortable and sleek ambidextrous design, the Viper Ultimate stands tall amongst its peers, offering one of the best gaming experiences you can have with a mouse.Razer designed the original wired Viper with a key feature set in mind – creating a light, fast, wickedly responsive and premium gaming mouse and the Viper Ultimate adds to that with the addition of wireless connectivity. Long gone are the days of wireless mice being shunned by gamers and only being reserved for travel or general purpose use, wireless mice now stand at the forefront of gaming with offerings from Razer, Corsair, Logitech, Steelseries and other major manufacturers as upgrades to their wired siblings.The Viper and Viper Ultimate offer an extremely comfortable shape and design that really shows how far Razer has come with their mouse design. Subtle comfort grooves in the buttons, crisp button presses, well-stepped mouse wheel, and extremely comfortable rubber sides really make the mouse feel premium. The Viper is ideal for medium to medium-large hands, offering comfortable grip options for both palm, claw, and hybrid grip styles. Fingertip grip is possible here, but not recommended as the mouse as a longer body that is not well suited to fingertip grip styles. Integrated firm rubber sides, textured matte plastic body, and super comfortable shape for left and right handed users really take the spotlight. The mouse has side buttons on both sides, but are cleverly designed so that you never have to worry about accidental presses on either side, and even if you are worried about still somehow hitting the side buttons on the opposite side of the mouse – it is a simple enough task to go into the software and disable them. The mouse is also extremely rigid and sturdy, having no flex or bowing at all, there is a slight rattle but I think it is either in the mouse wheel or lens of the sensor. Not sure though, but it is nothing to be worried about, pretty standard fare there, though I would like to see that eliminated in the future., Lighting is minimal, with the only RGB goodness being the classic Razer logo on the butt of the mouse being lit up, but the charging stand also has an RGB LED on its base and integrates seamlessly into the Razer Chroma ecosystem and works as expected.Ultra low latency, long battery life, and ditching the cable drag are great bullet points for any wireless mouse manufacturer to have – but only a few have managed to add “under 100g” to that list. Logitech launched their G Pro wireless last year with a surprising 78g weight that was lighter than most wired mice, and now that smaller, lighter mice are in – it was the perfect time for Razer to fire back. The Viper Ultimate weighs in at a shockingly light and nimble 74g (2.6 ounces), beating out everything but the Glorious Model O series, the Finalmouse UItralight 2, and the Coolermaster MM710. And at 74g, I would gladly give up my Finalmouse’s ultra-feathery light weight for a better shape and wireless capabilities. I’d also be shocked if we didn’t see an even lighter Viper out next year with the ever popular honey comb design and even lighter materials, I’m almost positive that they could get the weight below 50g with relative ease.So we have a masterful recipe for success here with a great weight and balance, wireless connectivity, and sleek design and shape, but what about the internals?I am glad to say that the inside of the Viper and Viper Ultimate are just as well designed as the outside. The sensor is the result of the partnership between PixArt and Razer, and what they’ve brought with the 3399 is an incredibly fast, accurate, top-of-the line optical sensor that is near flawless in its execution. While the reported resolution of the sensor goes up to a true 20,000 cpi – we all know that none of us will ever even come close to using that level of granularity given that the overwhelming majority of gamers use 2000 dpi or lower. But it is nice to know that the option is there – in the event that we have 20K displays. The bottom is equipped with pure 100% PTFE feet without any dye positioned at the corners of the mouse and around the sensor itself. The absence of the black dye means there is zero grittiness to the glide of the mouse when moving it, and rivals that of aftermarket mouse feet like Hyperglides. The only reason you’ll ever need to replace these feet is if they ever wear out, they’re as good as mouse feet get. The clicks are satisfying and tactile, offering an instant response due to their opto-electric nature. Speaking of which, the opto-electric switches are great! Because there are no actual contacts, the switches have an incredibly long lifespan, over 50 million clicks and are immune to double-clicking that their mechanical microswitch brethren are notorious for.Included with the mouse is a charging dock that functions both as a home for the wireless receiver if you so choose and as a convenient and fast way to charge the mouse when not in use. Simply plop the mouse on the dock when you walk away to get a drink or go to bed, it is as simple as that – not that you’ll need to do that very often. The Viper Ultimate sports a staggeringly impressive maximum battery life of 70+ hours on one charge, and can be charged from 0-80% in 90 minutes or less. The cable used to plug into the charging dock can be used to connect the mouse directly to the computer to be used in a wired state, if you for some reason should want to do that. It is very lightweight and flexible, only ever so slightly stiffer than the Viper wired cable. Let’s be real here though, if you’re buying a wireless mouse only to plug it in and use it wired, what are you doing?At $150, it might be a tough purchase for some – but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it. If you are looking for the absolute best wireless gaming mouse out there right now, the Viper Ultimate is it. There is little room for debate on whether or not the Viper Ultimate is the king of gaming mice in 2019. Ultimately though, the best mouse for you is the one that feels best in your hand. So many mice have top optical sensors and similar specs, that it comes down to personal preference in regards to the shape. For me, the Viper Ultimate shape fits my hands extraordinarily well, whereas the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 and Logitech G Pro wireless exist at opposite ends of comfort for me. The Ultralight 2 is too small for my hands, and the G Pro feels too much like a semi-circular plastic dome, but the Viper Ultimate is just right.If there’s anything I would consider changing it would be creating a honey-comb shell design that would further reduce the weight and possibly making the side buttons modular, similar to that of Logitech’s offerings so that if we so choose to could simply remove the side buttons for the side of the mouse that we are not using.Razer, 2019 is the year you came back hard. I love what you’re offering and I really hope 2020 brings as much if not more innovation to your future product lines. You guys are champions, once more."}
{"asin": "B07YPC3BQC", "username": "Ryan", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat so far but with a few issues that should be noted.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackStyle: Mouse + Dock", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Unfortunately most people probably only read 5 or 1 star reviews, but I feel I need to be honest.+ So far, sensor is good/accurate (of course).+ Optical switches don't feel quite as snappy but overall not that much different from mechanical ones. The switches are pretty much the entire reason I bought this mouse over other mice. I'M SO SICK OF THE DOUBLE CLICK ISSUE AND I'M PRAYING THIS FIXES IT. Happened to my original Naga, kept me from buying another Razer mouse but then it happened even worse to my Zowie EC2-A. They are about the same \"speed\" as normal switches. Latency isn't better or worse. You can test this online.+ This is my first wireless mouse and I'm pleased to say that wireless feels just as responsive  as wired mode. VERY nice to not have to deal with a wire anymore and not have any downsides.+ Good customization within Synapse such as button programming, lighting, power-saving mode threshold, custom DPI, lift-off distance, etc.+ Saving to onboard memory is great, as is having the option to log in to synapse as Guest.+ Different methods of using and charging the mouse is really nice.+ Feet are good. No issues and glide nicely on a QCK Heavy. Texture on the shell is good and grippy. I prefer this textured plastic over a rubber coating. Rubber sides feel good. Grippy and not mushy at all. Mouse wheel has good feedback and feels good to scroll (for now) and has a nice grippy texture. Side buttons and scroll wheel feel pretty good to click and the NORMAL ones aren't in the way (left side for right-handed, right side for left-handed). There's no play/travel distance on the side buttons like there is on some mice like my old EC2-A.+ Battery life seems good. Going to actually test it now on full charge with lighting off but so far it seems as-advertised, at least for the most part.- After leaving it charging all night through the direct connection and from maybe around 20%, Synapse only read a 97% charge. I restarted Synapse to see if it was reading wrong but it still read 97%. I placed it on the dock for a few minutes and it fully charged to 100%. Not sure what that's about but thought I'd mention it. Will test this more.- Unsure if it's just Windows 7 not playing nice with it, but when switching modes, the mouse sometimes doesn't allow me to interact with things outside of my online browser. For example,  I'll switch from wired to wireless mode and I'll be able to move my cursor and interact with my  browser but NOTHING else is interactable until I restart the Windows explorer process. I can't highlight icons, close or open programs, windows or anything. Very strange and really hope this won't be an ongoing issue.- Could be an issue on my end but Synapse doesn't recognize the mouse or dock on either of my USB 3.0 ports. ONLY when I use the wireless receiver by itself does it recognize the mouse in Synapse. If the receiver is in the dock or even if the wire is connected directly to the mouse, Synapse will not pick it up. I still have function but can't change any settings until I use a USB 2 port. Ports work fine with other hardware.- Just a few days in and, though still good, the mouse wheel has slightly lost some of it's  snappiness in it's scroll and the left and right clicks have developed a slight give. Somewhat  nitpicking here, but I would really hate it if the mouse felt like crap to use in just a few months.  For the price, this things should be rock solid for years and not develop that mushy cheapness.- Didn't think I would, but I constantly press the sidebuttons on the right side when I'm aiming (I use it in my right hand). I had to disable them through Synapse. Thankfully you can and then save the setting to internal  memory. Unfortunately, I can't use them now for other things if I wanted to, such as  volume control.- Some part of the Razer software (Razer Synapse Service Process) stays running even after you select \"Exit All Apps\" from the  tray icon. This happened with my old Razer Naga too. Normally, I wouldn't care THAT much, but this particular process KILLS fps in my games. I literally have to end the process or games stutter like crazy for some reason, or at least Overwatch does.- Really just personal opinion, but it'd be nice if Razer would make some smaller mice. Pretty much all of their mice are too big in one way or another for someone with smaller hands and depending on how you grip. This one is just a bit too long for me personally.Overall, I think if it lasts and the shell doesn't become mushy and creaky like it very well may with enough use, it's everything a competitive FPS player would ever need IF (big if) the mouse fits your hand well. Measure your hands and decide for yourself. Mine are roughly...H 7.25 inches x W 4.25 inches (H 18.415 cm x W 10.795 cm)3 finger width (index, middle, ring) =  2.125 inches (5.3975 cm)Middle finger + knuckle = 4 1/4 inches (10.795 cm)And I probably fall somewhere between claw and fingertip grip, probably leaning more towards fingertip.--------------------------------------------So far, for me, after less than one week with the mouse:Performance: 10/10Comfort: 6.5/10 (subjective and also still getting used to the shape so likely to go up, but hitting sidebuttons accidentally sucks - also my first ambidextrous)Feedback: 8.5/10 (this will get lower if the shell quality doesn't hold and the snappiness diminishes)Quality: 8/10 (mostly concerned about long-term quality here as left/right buttons already have some slight give/shake to them after a few days of use and the scroll doesn't feel like it's going to hold it's feeling of precision and snappiness in it's steps - otherwise though, pretty solid)Software: 7/10 (good options but a little too bloated - can thankfully choose which software you'd like to install)Value: 7/10 (I got it on sale for $120 but I think it's worth more around $100 - if it was perfect for my hand and grip, $120 would be kind of okay maybe, however twice the price of the wired is high enough - full price is simply too much and in the end, I might come to regret not just buying two $60 mice and a bungee)Currently, this mouse is hovering around an 8 or 8.5/10 for me. This is likely to go up to a 9 with use and as I get used to it's size and shape, just as long as quality and performance stays the same as it is now. Overall I commend Razer for innovating and listening to it's customers and I hope to enjoy this mouse with no issue for years to come."}

That should say how much I use my mouse, not counting how rough I am on my mice, such as when sliding & lifting them across my mouse-pad or the occasional accidental drop. This lead me to typically only buy Razer mice, because all of the other main brand mice usually break around the 5 month mark for me.This is not to mention my original Razer Deathadder V1 mouse lasted 7 years of VERY harsh daily use, and only failed because its scroll-wheel broke. (Abbreviating Deathadder to DA from now on)That's not to say I haven't had issues with Razer products, my first DA V2 lasted 1 week until both the left click and the scroll wheel started failing leading me to then use the other brand name mice; G502 Hero lasted 5 months, Corsair M55 lasted 2 weeks,and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste lasted 3 months.My next Razer product was a DA V2 pro and that one lasted 2 years, Which led me to buy this one after that one started not sensing right clicks.Issues:I had zero issues with it for 8 months, then, entirely out of random, started having weird issues with connectivity.  This started out with very minuscule connectivity issues, such as it waiting 30 seconds for my PC and Razer's software to start working properly to use the mouse when it gets turned on after being off for a while.This was annoying, but I didn't care too much about that since I could still do whatever I needed to do.But fast forward ~4 months and the issues have compounded a little bit and I get my connection cut off when playing games for a solid 4 seconds at a time, and at this point this is getting REALLY annoying to endure (This happens plugged in too).At this point I am also having issues with the mouse having a slowed reception & it being able to hold a charge for more than half a day. I used to be able to use it at it's highest pulling rate and low brightness of the LED for 5 days without charging.Positives:Very durable plastic, I have very little wear on the mouse besides a bit of wear on the left click plastic making it shiny instead of matte black.Very comfortable if you claw grip your mouse (Not comfortable if you palm the entire mouse).Very light and easy to move on a mouse-pad.Fairly priced, ~$60 is quite decent for this mouse.Lasted 10 Months until having some bigger issues (Most mice completely break around the 5th month for me).Scroll wheel is perfect, zero squeaking (like a Corsair M55) or aggressive rumble feeling (like a Logitech G502) and has a good rubberized texture to it (HyperX Pulsefire haste didn't have any great texturing).Great for putting into a schoolbag for college or for storing in a laptop case.Buttons and sensor are great and feel immaculate.Cons:Either the USB dongle, or the mouse itself is having issues cutting out and not working at random after close to a year of use. The same with sensitivity, it has definitely gone down for the sensor.Battery is now starting to have issues holding a charge.This is where I am currently at with this mouse, It has worked very well for what it is, but I may soon have to upgrade, due to the issues I am having.You will probably have a longer service life on your mouse though, especially if you are not rough on your electronics.I would 100% recommend this if you need it for a laptop and need it to be wireless, or have smaller hands that are not as fitting for a Razer Deathadder."}

Slightly annoying, but I'm still happy with the performance for the money spent.** Update, I would get another mouse. This thing is TOO lightweight. If you play a song that some guy hit the bass drum once, the cursor is moving on you. I've been playing FPS games all of my life, but I can't get the flick down for this mouse; the lack of weight gives 0 feedback to your hand. You are basically reactionary to everything. By that, I mean move the mouse first, react to how the screen moves, then adjust accordingly. Hard to get muscle memory to something that delivers no feedback cause this things weighs as much as a penny.Battery Life, Charging and the Razer app were all good, no issues to report on that."}

The battery life is never a concern and I often don't even put it back on the dock because it has 70 hours of battery life anyway. I bought the white version and the RGB pops even more. The more aggressive design is very cool but the feel in the hand is also great. Light but sturdy feel. I don't like some of the Logitech mice for this reason but Razer has done it well. Great click to the buttons and roll to the scroll wheel. The magnets in the dock work great and it looks very good on my desk. I love this mouse and recommend it to anyone who can spend the money for it. It is steep at 150 but maybe wait for a deal to drop."}

I frequently play Rainbow 6 Siege and OSU!, both games which are very reliant on the ability to aim. while I use the same DPI and sensitivity on this mouse as I have with my prior ones, this one for some reason makes aiming so much easier. The battery life is incredibly good averaging about 10-12 hours before needing a charge, and Razer software gives you a healthy heads up when your battery is getting low, so there's never a concern for it dying in game. The connection speed is incredibly fast, 0 notable latency while wireless, and it shows the same speed while wired and charging. My only complaint (which isn't worthy of being a complaint) is that the Razer symbol that glows, gets covered by your own hands, so you cant really see any of the LED effects that you set up."}

I was using the G502 for around six years. My review heavily compares against the G502. Let's start. This HyperX mouse is so fantastic, especially for the price.-The sensor, Pixart's Paw 3335 derives from the PMW 3389. The 3335 is a low power version of the 3389. The sensor is excellent, so don't let any uninformed reviewers steer you wrong. I haven't seen or felt any difference in FPS games other than me actually being quicker, because the mouse is 1/3 of the weight I'm used to.-The TTC Gold 80m switches are great. They have a deeper tone and feel REALLY good.-The wireless receiver is also preferred over the one I had with Logitech simply because it's got some grip on the bottom and stays where I want it lol.-The mouse is extremely comfortable. I go between a palm and claw grip and have smaller, thinner fingers/hands. I find it immensely more comfortable than the G502, but I know that's subjective. I was afraid I'd miss the thumb rest from the G502, but honestly, I haven't missed it at all. This mouse just overall feels WAY better. There's a slightly textured matte finish which feels SUPERB and looks amazing. I hated the nasty glossy look my G502 had, even worse after it was worn down. I also much prefer the scroll wheel. It's a little more low-profile and feels way more natural to use.-I'm extremely impressed that it came with skates already on the mouse and an extra blue pair. It also came with some REALLY nice grip stickers that I'm loving. I've only put on the grips for the left and right mouse buttons so far, as you can see in my pics, but it also comes with grips for the side of the mouse I'll be sticking on later.-I was a little nervous at first that the HyperX software is through the Microsoft store, but it's extremely straight-forward with depth like Logitech's. In fact, I also find it way easier to use and navigate through. It just makes sense and has every option you need. There's also the low-power warning that you can set to any percentage of battery left which is really nice.Long story short, I'm so freaking impressed and in love with this mouse. I just became a big HyperX fan. It's like they just get it.If anything changes, I'll be back to edit this review."}
{"asin": "B09TLCRGMN", "username": "B", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nFrom a competitive FPS gamer's POV, this is the best mouse I've used", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2023", "purchased": "Color: Black/RedPattern Name: Wired", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "To preface, I play competitive FPS games and have competed at ESEA-Main level in CS:GO and Diamond rank in Rainbow Six: Siege. I've purchased tried dozens of mice over the years in search of a mouse that would be the most comfortable for me. To name some that I've used in the past: Razer Deathadder, Basilisk, SteelSeries Rival 300, Rival 300 Wireless, Sensei 310, Aerox 3 Wireless, Zowie EC1-A, EC2-B, ZA12-B, Nixeus Revel, Dream Machines DM1 Pro S, and Logitech G Pro. There are probably some others that I've forgotten about, however, the point is that the HyperX Pulsefire Haste immediately felt more natural to me than many of the mice that I've been using and practicing with for years now (previously maining the Nixeus Revel for ~2 years).Shape is subjective however, so it would be difficult for me to say that this mouse is for everyone, however, coming from a sensei shape, I very much found it to be similar enough, while addressing many of the issues I had (primarily I wanted the rear to be flared out a bit more so I could rest the base of my thumb for support). I suspect that those who enjoy the Zowie FK series will also take a liking to this mouse. For reference, I use a mix of fingertip/claw grip, probably closer to a relaxed claw.The clicks are a great balance between the lighter Omron and heavier Huanos, and have solid, satisfying feedback. The side buttons seem to be quality with great feedback as well, and feel very sturdy with little wiggle, being among the best of the mice I've used thus far. The sensor is also very high quality, though with today's sensor technologies, it would be extremely rare for most to encounter any real issues. Build quality is excellent, as when I flex and squeeze on the mouse, there are no creaks whatsoever, and the whole thing feels very solid.For those like me who are always looking to try out new mice for that extra bit of natural feeling, or the casual gamer, you certainly won't be disappointed - especially for the price!"}

{"asin": "B09TLCRGMN", "username": "Just Erik", "title": "2.0 out of 5 stars\nMediocre, Much Room for Improvement", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023", "purchased": "Color: Black/RedPattern Name: Wired", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I don't beat my mice up in terms of taking care of them, but I do use the ever loving hell out of them. This is a overall mediocre offering and they do wear out farely quickly. I bought 3 of these, just switched to the third one after a 2-3 months each of the first two. They still work okay, nothing defective, I'm just running each through the paces to check them out, make sure they work. So far, there's some major drawbacks that I'm experiencing.The first is that the mouseswheel isn't always accurate. It's far from the worst I've experienced and hasn't malfunctioned, but you do get some extra/imprecise scrolling which tends to present itself the more you use it. It doesn't have enough of a tactile feeling which lends itself to being imprecise as well. Quite a bit of room for improvement here. I'd rate the mousewheel maybe a 5/10.The cord is subpar trash. It is way too light. I think it might be designed by people who strictly play RTS and go for incredibly high sensitivities, people that barely move their mouse and are overwhelming strictly wrist aimers. If you play different FPS and actually have a normal sensitivity (e.g. 28-50 cm/360) then this cord is going to be a nightmare. It catches on itself, doubles over on itself, and will even get in the way of the mouse movement itself. It's garbage and I'd rate it a 2/10 at best.The next is that the overall construction while at first feels solid, after a couple months of heavy use it starts to creak everywhere. The sides, the top, just the whole thing gets these little creaks like a crappy, cheap, low-budget mouse. Even one of the switches is starting to feel a bit scratchy. After these 2-3 months of heavy use of two of them, I'd rate the overall construction to be maybe 5/10 at best.Everything still works, it's just after the honeymoon phase the issues start to present themselves quite clearly. It's arguably better than many other mice I've used (I'm looking at you Razor) and as long as nothing breaks I'll probably use them for awhile longer. Sunk cost fallacy and all that. Overall I'd rate this mouse a solid 4.5/10 relative to others. The main clicks do feel good, the side buttons are functional if cheap feeling, the shape is solid, and it is nice and lightweight. It just gets creaky and cheap after awhile with an imprecise, non-tactile mousewheel, and perhaps the worst mouse cord possible for an FPS player. I would definitely not recommend this mouse at the full asking price though. Wait for a good discount or you will end up disappointed."}

Mouse was a lot better than the photon but didn't like how it forced my finger into position. Also don't think it was that good for relaxed finger/ claw so ended up returning that too. Then I got this mouse, was skeptical because of the cheap price but ended up being my favorite. Mouse is so good for claw and build quality was really good with mine. Also has the best glide out of any of the mice I've tried and scroll wheel is super light and smooth. Overall mouse really surprised me and I definitely recommend."}

The shape is somewhere in between the Superlight and the Viper. The center hump is not as tall as the Superlight, but it is also not as flat as the Viper. This makes it perfect for most hand sizes and hand grips (I play claw and I have large hands). On paper, the sensor is slightly worse in terms of tracking and latency, but I haven't noticed any real difference while playing competitive games like Valorant. The main thing that sets it apart from those two extremely expensive mice though is the quality. It is superior in every way. None of the buttons feel mushy, unlike the Superlight. The material is a sort of grippy plastic and doesn't feel cheap. Overall, excellent mouse, and will continue to use it over my Superlight and Viper."}

{"asin": "B07YPBQSCK", "username": "Dudodian", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat price for the quality", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2020", "purchased": "Size: Mouse", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Firstly, one important thing to address is that this is a review for the Razer Basilisk X mouse, not the Razer Basilisk Ultimate, which is the majorly upgraded version of the mouse. Most reviews, for some reason, are of the Basilisk Ultimate, but with the one picture and the one you order on this page, you will be getting the battery powered Razer Basilisk X.TL;DR: I used this mouse for a month for office use. Great price for what you get. Feels nice in hand using common grips (claw, palm, fingertip), responsive clicking, nice scrolling, glides well across mouse mats, fair for gaming, really good battery life.I have only ever used wired mice. I wanted a wireless mouse for office use because my desk got smaller. I also share a desk now, and wires go everywhere from our headsets, keyboard, desk decorations, etc. To say the least, I wanted something cheap, but something I could still rely on with decent quality for the price. After doing some extensive research, I limited myself down to Logitech or Razer. When I finally laid eyes on the Basilisk X, I liked the look and the features. The more I thought about it, the more I fell in love with it. I was skeptical, as I've never used a wireless mouse. However, below are my thoughts after a month's use regarding the mouse and why I think, for the price, this mouse deserves five stars.To start, the price falls at $59.99 at the time of writing this review. Even in paying full price, I felt that I was receiving a great quality mouse. Below are some more specifications of this.Firstly, when getting the mouse, you get some detailed instructions regarding how to set it up. This is a nice touch, as trying to offhandedly figure out where the battery compartment and the USB stick is can be difficult. The cover lifts up nicely, but is a little hard to put back on. Ultimately, though, it has a nice compartment for the USB stick and for the battery. This mouse takes one AA battery inserted into the mouse. The weight of the mouse is very light and it's easily mobile. The build of the mouse feels decent for the price, and seems durable. The look overall of a matte black with some glossy parts and highlights is personal preference, but I do like its simplistic look with no lights on it.Overall, the feel of this mouse is nice in the hand. I used it in a few different grips to sample how it would feel. I used claw, palm, and fingertip, the most common grips I could think of. When using each grip, each time, I did feel relatively comfortable. The mouse fits rather well in my medium-large hands. I personally use a hybrid palm and claw grip, in the sense that my palm encompasses a large amount of the mouse, but my fingers are raised slightly. It is a little less comfortable for this type of grip, but you can still feel comfort using the mouse. It seems from my usage the mouse is mostly intended for palm grip, but that shouldn't discount other grips at least trying the mouse. It's much better than the mice the office provides me, trust me on that. As for the other parts of the mouse, such as the buttons and scroll wheels, I like the clicky responsiveness of the mouse buttons. Also, my fingers don't hang over the edge, even when using palm grip, which I personally love. I rather like the scroll wheel because It doesn't take too much pressure to move it up or down, but locks into place pretty solidly with ease. It is relatively easy to scroll at fast paces, but not seemingly as easy as a Logitech mouse, which my friend allowed me to use for a moment (more on that later). There are three other buttons to be used, one below the scroll wheel, and two next to the thumb. One complaint I had about some other mice I used, including Steelseries and (in some mice) Corsair, involved me accidentally pressing this sensitivity button below the scroll wheel. Well, I can safely say I've never had an accidental press of the sensitivity button. Since I am clumsy, though, I do accidentally press the two buttons on the side of the mouse every so often. However, whenever I have a mouse that has buttons in those places, I always click them on accident, no matter the mouse, so I cannot fault it for that. The buttons on the side stick out a little more than I usually see on other mice, but they don't get in the way, especially the sensitivity button. It sits flush with the two buttons used to click. Overall, you get pretty easy access to the thumb buttons when using the provided thumb rest as well. I can say it has a more simplistic design, which some will favor over multiple buttons. The cover in the back for the battery and USB holder have never come off accidentally for me, and I haven't had issues otherwise with the build. I'd say if you have medium hands, this would probably be the mouse for you, but with someone like me who has hands that are somewhat large, it works well still.Moving along swiftly, I'll now cover how the mouse performs when moving it around, and then dive into gaming with the mouse. Overall, on a decent quality mouse mat, the mouse glides really smoothly across the surface and calibrates easy. All you have to do to calibrate it to the surface you're on, software or not, is hold down the button just below the scroll wheel for a few seconds, and then it is calibrated and optimized for the surface it's on. It's never caught itself on anything and feels pretty smooth, albeit a little bit speedy. Otherwise, it's very elegant in its dance across a surface.Finally, the point that I've been looking forward to most, which is gaming. This is a gaming mouse so, after all, how does it perform for gaming? Well, after spending a few days gaming with this mouse instead of my regular mouse, a Corsair Nightsword, I can say it isn't too bad. Granted, I will always recommend a wired mouse for certain types of games, but if you want something wireless where delay and response time are not as important, this could be a great mouse for you. I spent time playing Destiny 2, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, and even the rhythm game osu! The delay is a little more noticeable here, but it is still not that bad. It was easy to be precise, though, of course, it was an adjustment. After playing with it a few days, I was able to play at around my normal level, which isn't that good to begin with. Needless to say, it does its job with certain types of games, but for the FPS genre or reaction time sensitive games, you might notice the delay. Granted, you could probably get used to it, but you might get better results from a higher tier mouse or from a wired one. That's not to say that the mouse didn't perform, because it very well did. I'm sure that if I played Dota 2, an RTS, or an MMO, that this mouse would still be viable, but from what I understand, you may want some more keybinds readily accessible if you're going to play an RTS or MMO. To wrap it up, though, it does its job.Lastly, battery life. I went into this with a grain of salt. I saw a review saying it ate batteries in the matter of a week and a half repeatedly, so for Razer to claim up to 285 hours of hyperspeed wireless, I was a bit skeptical. However, I had one Energizer battery that came with the mouse (thanks Razer!) and it lasted a full month. Keep in mind, this was for office use, and I have a desk partner. As soon as she leaves, I am right there to take over her station (she loves the mouse too by the way). She works eight hour shifts five days a week, while I work six hour days, four days a week. I figured calculating out this mouse's approximate battery usage using just these numbers would be inaccurate or possibly a bit skewed, so I'll just leave it at the pure statistics of how often we use it to prove the battery life. Also, only one AA battery. To say the least, you may pay for some batteries, but I really can't complain with the battery life I get from it.So, if you've stuck around this long, I want to thank you for sticking around, and I hope that if you're considering buying this mouse, I have laid out what my experience with this mouse was for a month regarding office usage. Take the gaming section with a small grain of salt as I didn't use it for more than a couple days. And again, this article is mostly opinion, but I tried to keep it open to show some cons, but mostly pros for why I like it. Thanks again!"}

The speed is great and it's a solid experience. When it's working, it's a dream.But then there's the software. You have to install it or else the mouse will bug you all the time to install it. And when you do install it, it's intrusive and settings seem not to stick. It will randomly change speeds, or you'll accidentally bump the speed change button and change speeds.The speed button is a stupid gimmick that gets in the way more than it comes in handy, I'd rather it wasn't there and change the cursor speed in settings instead of on the fly.The software also asks you to create an account and sign in. When connected online, it somehow causes all kind of problems like disconnects and going to sleep randomly. The battery needs to be removed and re-inserted to get it to wake up from whatever random coma it went into. All these problems can be avoided if you don't create an account and sign in, or if you don't install software.Finally, the battery life is hilariously terrible, although It's only funny because I use rechargeable NiMH batteries. This mouse chews thru them like nothing i've seen. If I'm using it as my main mouse, it will eat a full (rechargeable) battery in as little as one day. My generic $20 logitech mouse I use for work will last a good 6 months on the exact same battery. You can use alkaline batteries, but at most you'll get 5 days out of each one and you'll pay the cost of the mouse again in batteries in very short order.I wouldn't buy this again. 2.5 out of 5"}

I'm sure that if I played Dota 2, an RTS, or an MMO, that this mouse would still be viable, but from what I understand, you may want some more keybinds readily accessible if you're going to play an RTS or MMO. To wrap it up, though, it does its job.Lastly, battery life. I went into this with a grain of salt. I saw a review saying it ate batteries in the matter of a week and a half repeatedly, so for Razer to claim up to 285 hours of hyperspeed wireless, I was a bit skeptical. However, I had one Energizer battery that came with the mouse (thanks Razer!) and it lasted a full month. Keep in mind, this was for office use, and I have a desk partner. As soon as she leaves, I am right there to take over her station (she loves the mouse too by the way). She works eight hour shifts five days a week, while I work six hour days, four days a week. I figured calculating out this mouse's approximate battery usage using just these numbers would be inaccurate or possibly a bit skewed, so I'll just leave it at the pure statistics of how often we use it to prove the battery life. Also, only one AA battery. To say the least, you may pay for some batteries, but I really can't complain with the battery life I get from it.So, if you've stuck around this long, I want to thank you for sticking around, and I hope that if you're considering buying this mouse, I have laid out what my experience with this mouse was for a month regarding office usage. Take the gaming section with a small grain of salt as I didn't use it for more than a couple days. And again, this article is mostly opinion, but I tried to keep it open to show some cons, but mostly pros for why I like it. Thanks again!"}

Devours batteries.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023", "purchased": "Size: Mouse", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I've owned this mouse for a little over a year, so this is a long term review.On the positive side, this mouse is very responsive and ergonomic. The speed is great and it's a solid experience. When it's working, it's a dream.But then there's the software. You have to install it or else the mouse will bug you all the time to install it. And when you do install it, it's intrusive and settings seem not to stick. It will randomly change speeds, or you'll accidentally bump the speed change button and change speeds.The speed button is a stupid gimmick that gets in the way more than it comes in handy, I'd rather it wasn't there and change the cursor speed in settings instead of on the fly.The software also asks you to create an account and sign in. When connected online, it somehow causes all kind of problems like disconnects and going to sleep randomly. The battery needs to be removed and re-inserted to get it to wake up from whatever random coma it went into. All these problems can be avoided if you don't create an account and sign in, or if you don't install software.Finally, the battery life is hilariously terrible, although It's only funny because I use rechargeable NiMH batteries. This mouse chews thru them like nothing i've seen. If I'm using it as my main mouse, it will eat a full (rechargeable) battery in as little as one day. My generic $20 logitech mouse I use for work will last a good 6 months on the exact same battery. You can use alkaline batteries, but at most you'll get 5 days out of each one and you'll pay the cost of the mouse again in batteries in very short order.I wouldn't buy this again. 2.5 out of 5"}

I tried a few different mice and my previous main mouse was the Glorious Model D, both wired and wireless. It's been a great mouse but I found the wireless version battery doesn't last more than a day and it's been \"wired\" almost full time. Started to be frustrated with all of the cables on my desk and tried to find another wireless that fit my hand but also wasn't super heavy, low latency and had good battery life.From the reviews, the top gaming mouse was the Logitech G Pro X, very expensive but I wanted the lowest latency possible. While the performance of the Pro X was great, the body feel was very cheap and almost like a plastic Easter Eggshell. The body also felt too slick and combined with the extreme lightweight just didn't vibe with me.For work I have a Razer v1 Viper wired, it's good but the buttons feel slightly mushy, so I didn't check Razer for a gaming replacement at first. Later I ended up buying a Razer v1 Viper wireless, and looks like they fixed the buttons, they were very snappy and the latency of the wireless was almost the same as the wired. After such a positive experience, I was going to buy another v1 but with the news of the v2 coming out I held out.From the first out-of-the-box experience with the v2 Viper, I first noticed they removed the dock and there's no longer any quick charge ability. Honesly, this isn't a big deal, if you need to charge the mouse, just plug it in, and use it. With the dock, it's sitting on the stand, taking up space. The mouse is now USB-C which is nice, comes with the same very flexible cable, and the wireless dongle has a nice extender where you can have sitting as close to the mouse as possible (reduces latency).What's the biggest change on the mouse? It's very noticeable of the weight reduction, it's about 12g of difference, but at 58g, it still feels very solid (much better over the Pro X). The body of the mouse is the same as the other Vipers, it's slightly rough but doesn't feel cheap, fitment is great in my medium hand. It is worth noting Razer had to remove a few features of the v1 Viper in order to reduce weight.One thing is it's a solid black mouse, I love the new look. The only indication of any LED's is a very small dot right below the mouse wheel, this indicates the battery charge. There's no other LED's on the mouse so keep that in mind if you're looking for matching the keyboard. Another change is the removable of the right side \"thumb buttons\". The v1 Viper allows for right and left-handed use, but the v2 Viper only has the buttons on the left side (for the right handed user). A nice bonus is the included grips (four pieces, two side stickers, two for the buttons), these are very grippy type of rubber.While I haven't owned the v2 Viper wireless long, it has great latency on the wireless side and with the light weight doesn't feel any more than my wired mice. The pricing is a bit steep but it's on par with other high end gaming mice, I would choose this over the other brands based on the Razer fits my hand the best and has the best click feel.Downsides?

That is what the targeted customer base is anyway, so I expected a great mouse. After all, I paid nearly $150 which many would consider exorbitant for a mouse. For context, I've only had the mouse since March 30 (it is now June 7th). After only a short few months of heavy use, the 'forward' side button now flickers in and out. I competitively play a game where I use these buttons to lean, so it is extremely noticeable when my character constantly flickers from leaning to not leaning as a result of the button flickering from working to not working. It is very lightweight and feels great, but I cannot justify it at this price point if it is already having issues only a few months after purchase. I am disappointed and have returned to my more reliable logitech g305 (even though it is a bit heavier).EDIT:The issue fixed itself, but I am still a tad disappointed that it existed in the first place considering how expensive this mouse is.

It’s extremely lightweight at just ~59 grams for the white model without any holes. Sure to achieve this, Razer had to cut some parts such as the wireless charging dock, the right side buttons, side grips, and other features, but professionals, as in the name v2 pro, don’t really care all too much for the features removed. Additionally, the viper v2 pro has amazing build quality. No creaking or rattling on my unit whatsoever. All in all, the mouse itself is phenomenal.What isn’t is the dongle. Many users, including myself, have reported the dongle broken on arrival. I tried updating the firmware, reinstalling synapse, and even deleting the infamous vanguard to fix it. Nothing worked. The only way to connect the mouse would be through the included wire, which isn’t by any means very good for performance as it’s very stiff (although to cut Razer some slack, it wasn’t really intended to be used plugged in). However Razer support helped me guide through these issues without any problems.In conclusion, this is one of the best mouse on the market currently if you’re willing to take a gamble at Razer’s QC."}

I tried adjusting it and even disassembled it entirely at one point in an attempt to fix the right click. I was unable to get it working consistently again.It was a good mouse for about a year and a more or less functional one for about a year and a half of what most people would likely consider to be heavy use with basic cleaning and maintenance. The battery never gave me any trouble, but the mechanical parts of the mouse did breakdown over time.As a comparison I have a little wireless 12 dollar mouse I also got through amazon that has outlived it and continues to function just fine. I understand from my general attempts at troubleshooting that the mouse wheel going 'fuzzy' is actually a common issue with these, there are 'fixes' provided by users on youtube.

The mouse itself was still fine, but the little USB connector (the wireless receiver) bit ended up breaking and left itself in my computer’s USB port. I haven’t used that computer for a while for unrelated reasons, but I’m pretty sure I got it out. If I recall correctly, the wired version still works, but I much prefer wireless mice. With my intermittent usage (maybe a couple times a month), it that little wireless receiver worked for a couple years. I’m sad that it broke haha.

The clicks feel great and the mouse is comfortable to hold even with my big hands. The only gripe I have with this mouse is you cannot use the rainbow colors without having the razer synapse software running in the background. If you want to use any customizable colors at all you have to have the software running or else it will default to spectrum color cycling. Even if you set the colors and then close the software it wont save your settings and will just revert to the default as soon as the app closes. Very very annoying and I've never seen this happen with any other peripheral. Every time the PC boots up it has to wait for the software to start before the mouse even changes to RGB. Kinda seems like they just want to force you to run their software which is very shady."}

I read so many bad reviews about the mouse itself or the software and I am so shocked that people feel the way they do. Sure the software isn't the best it could be but it works well and gets the job done. But I'll say I do not mess with it too much once I have things set how I like.I have been through so many mice over the last year.Coolermaster CM710 (incredible mouse but too small for my hands)Zowie EC2 (very slick and slips in my hands but is a good size. Cable is unbelievably thick and stiff though)Logitech G403 (as a mouse it's a great design but logitech's software is miserable and doesn't recognize the mouse half the time and between two of these G403's the left click went out within 2mo of playing FPS games where it became incredibly inconsistent in registering the click)Glorious Model D (great mouse overall but the cord got annoying. The Coolermaster cable is similar to this one but doesn't flail around and land on your hand like this one's does and even their own mouse bungee didn't secure the cord as it would slip out of the connector - but great quality mouse)Going through these mice is what led me to finally going with the Razer Mamba. I was ready to get away from dealing with cables now that the wireless tech seems to finally be here and I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I have spent hundreds on them over the last year and I wasn't sure I'd like Razer so I wanted to keep the investment minimal. Well, despite buying this at a pretty low price (I believe around $50) it has become a top 3 favorite mouse for me. I know it's not some super fancy mouse with tons of features but all I really cared about was reliable wireless, forward/back buttons, a nice fit for my hand, not too heavy.So far after about 2 months this has been THE mouse for me. I don't know a lot about other Razer products but I will say that I will look to their mice before any other brand unless I experience something worth skipping them and so far I'm not seeing that happening. I will update if it does since i've only had it about 50 days but so far so great!"}

Unfortunately, it's just not comfortable enough for me to use for more than a few minutes.I'm fine with the claw, palm, and fingertip grip styles, so I wasn't concerned about this being designed around a palm-grip.  That wasn't an issue for me.  Instead, it's that it's poorly shaped for any of those grips.The mouse is large, which is normally fine.  Unfortunately, the sides of the mouse make it even larger.  The left side has a slight outward taper, and the right side has a pronounced outward taper.  The tapered sides are covered with a low-friction rubber, making them even more useless to grip.  Because of this, my hand fatigues quickly when using the mouse, as the wide palm and wider, slippery \"grip\" areas make it harder to control than it should be.Typically, most mice (even palm-style) taper inward or straight down before tapering out on the sides.  This allows a place for the fingers and thumb to rest, and allows them to be used for control.  The Mamba appeared to be the same in the pictures, but it really isn't.My son and my GF both tried it as well, and neither liked it.  I brought it into work, offering it to any coworker who wanted it.  Many tried it, but no one liked it.  Finally, one took it home to give to his kid.  I feel sorry for that kid.There are far better mice for this price, for all styles.  Light or not, big or little, palm or claw or fingertip, \"gaming\" or not, each of them is better than this.Maybe the tech is good. Maybe it's durable.  Maybe the quality of components is top notch.  Maybe the software is even good.  I simply don't know, as I refuse to use it long enough to find out.This might fit your hands well.  Many people here seem to like it.  Not me.  Good luck!"}

Had 2 Logitech gaming mice and still using the 2and one on my laptop now.This Razer mouse has a much nicer feel overall, it is amazing at how well it responds to your movement.The mouse is a good sized, nicely weighted comfortable feeling in the hand mouse.If you own a Razer chroma keyboard then you already know you need to connect to the internet to use more advanced features.I own a Black Widow keyboard and as soon as I connected the mouse they recognized each other and updated software downloaded and installed dated my reviewing it.The new arrangement now allows both devices to have the same pr similar light functions. This is pretty cool looking if you ask me.If LED is not your thing then by all means skip on any noise with LED features.However, if like me you got a Razer chroma keyboard then you love your LED lights.Now the lights on the mouse as is with the keyboard are the icing on the already amazing cake. And, unlike Portal thos cake is real.The wheel is amazingly sensitive. Has a lumpy rubberized surface making it very nice to touch and use.The wheel has multiple click options one being a light press you can access the menu options to open a new tab and such.Press a little harder or a normal press on my old gaming mouse and it allows you to scroll around the screen just by moving the mouse. That one takes getting used to. Not sure if this is something you can change yet.Theforqard and back buttons are located spot on perfect for my hands. I am a size large glove to give you a reference.You can use the DPI buttons right in front of the wheel to adjust things on the fly. And, let me tell you this  is amazing when you need the accuracy for certain needs and don't for others.The only con I can think of is the price point.However, for that price you get one amazing mouse.Also, to add more icing ot sprinkles to the cake you get some cool Razer themed stickers My Balckwidow keyboard didn't come with stickers that I recall.Overall this is a wonderful mouse packed with all sorts of actual features. With the added fun of LED light and ddcdirent and new modes compared to my keyboard. Works flawlessly with my Razer keyboard.Highly recommend."}

I decided to go wireless this time so that I wouldn't have to deal with anymore cables (Apart from the charging cable), and I think I made a very good choice.For those that complain about the amount of time you get for a full charge, this issue is completely mitigated if you charge the mouse every night before you go to sleep, which is what I do. Every morning I wake up, I have a full charge ready to go. Other than that, the ergonomics for me at least are a bit off since I have slightly bigger hands, but I can still manage with it.Apart from being a great gaming mouse (With all the programmable buttons, profiles, DPI stages, etc etc), it works nicely as a good general purpose mouse.I only have two nitpicks, 1 is that sometimes the lights change when I don't want it to, but I suspect this just might be a result of Synapse 3 not working well, and my other nitpick is how the mouse behaves when you plug it in to charge:- When the charging cable is plugged in directly to the computer and you plug the mouse in, it turns off for a second or two and then comes back on, to which you can continue to use it normally.- When the charging cable is not plugged into the computer (maybe via a brick in an outlet or a power strip that has USB ports (this is how I charge my mouse)), even if the mouse is on, the mouse will turn off and not turn back on.Strange behavior, but concerning how I never use it plugged in but wireless (that's the point, isn't it?), I have had no problems.Overall, I got this mouse on sale for $45, and I think it was a great choice. I would definitely recommend this mouse for others to use."}

I've used it both at home for gaming and at work. The thing has been a champ in my backpack. Love how light, comfortable, and flexible it is.I only have two problems with it:1. I hate that Windows basically requires you to install the Razer software (it will automatically try to install it as soon as the mouse is plugged in). Luckily on Ubuntu, it works out of the box with no software required. But that's the life of modern gaming. You've got your software for your mouse, another for your keyboard, another for your headset, another for your harddrive, and on and on. Unless you choose one company for it all, I guess.2. The second problem is the buttons. After two and a half years of faithful service, my left click button has developed the dreaded issue I've seen others mention. When clicked down, the button will multi-click, instead of staying clicked. This makes drag and drop functionality impossible.But hey, I love Razer mice. I already have two, and I just ordered another wireless one to replace this. I'll miss you, Mamba. We've built some beautiful things together. I would definitely rate it lower if I had bought it for full price though. It goes on discount often. Buy it then!"}

No double-clicking and no ghost-clicking. Just a simple mouse with sleek RBG you can actually see that actually works with Synapse Chroma. It has a mid-high profile so it fits well in the palm as I tend to hold the mouse towards the back. The cord is braided and lightweight so it doesn't bunch up as easily. It glides across most mousepads with relative ease, but not too much to go flying off your desk.The sides of the mouse, typically where you grip, have a nice rubberized texture. I've never had issues holding onto a mouse, but it does help. The side mouse buttons are almost flush with the form factor of the mouse, but they're still easy to press and distinguish from each other without having any mis-clicks.Clicking is kind of loud. It's pretty standard for these kind of mice from Razer. Scroll wheel is slightly more forward than I prefer, but it's probably to fit the DPI buttons as there are two different ones so you're not slam shifting just one of them to cycle.The worst part of this mouse that I personally don't like is that it has a two-stage scroll wheel button. You press lightly for the first click and then slightly harder for the second click. While having more buttons without putting additional buttons on the mouse is often a great idea ... This two-stage scroll wheel button is not ideal. You /will/ find yourself pressing your scroll wheel button and hitting BOTH clicks almost every time when you only intend to do one. To make matters worse, the scroll wheel will also register scrolling while clicking as well which can be a nightmare while gaming. Not to mention it's actually really easy to accidentally click the scroll wheel when just scrolling regardless of hand posture.Not a deal breaker, but it means I have to remap controls from scroll wheel or disable any hotkeys because I got tired of accidentally chucking lethal grenades in Call of Duty when I meant to switch weapons."}

I will keep this mouse because it's comfortable to use if you aren't gaming, but I will definitely recommend a different one for gaming.-----------------------------I just received my new Razer Mamba wireless mouse, and I'm honestly very satisfied with it. It feels good in my hand, the clicks feel good, and it's very responsive. I always wanted to get a Razer mouse, so as a first time Razer user I think it's a great starting point.WHAT I LOVE:- RGB Effects: I used Chroma Studio to create led effects. You can set the lights to change color or to light up from your microphone or speaker sounds, you can set light effects when clicking the mouse, you can make it \"breathe\", etc... You can pretty much create any visual effect you want with it.- Ergonometric Design: My hand feels very comfortable when using this mouse!- Smoothness: I got a goliathus mouse pad as I'm always carrying my laptop around. Combining this mouse with a \"low end\" razer mouse pad is enough to get a great experience from this mouse.- Mouse Wheel Grip: The mouse wheel has little studs which helps you get a better grip when spinning it. I really liked this feature.- Side Buttons: The side buttons don't get in the way when grabbing the mouse. You won't be clicking them by accident or anything.RESPONSES TO BAD COMMENTS- Not Being Able to Use It When Charging: This is not true. I just tested it, and it works! Windows just automatically installs a new driver to use it as a regular wired mouse. I reckon people's windows security settings were blocking the download of the new driver?- Clicking and Dragging Issues:  I haven't had any issues so far. I'll update post if the problem develops.- Bad Battery Life: I charged it 20 hours ago, and I'm still at 85%. I give my mouse heavy use doing CAD models and gaming in my free time. I'm very surprised I haven't needed to charge it considering I'm running a ton of RGB effects when clicking, \"breathing\" effects, and when I speak on the microphone.- Razer Synapse Software: I honestly don't understand why people were having issues with the software not being compatible with the mouse. The software has a super easy user interface and it works very well.- Need to Turn Off After Use: A lot of people said they needed to turn their mouse off after use to avoid battery drainage. I don't think this is necessary. The mouse goes to sleep mode when you don't use it. I left it on all night list night, and it did not drain my battery.Honestly, if you like how the mouse looks, buy it and give it a try! I feel satisfied with this mouse so far, so I would recommend it to anyone."}

I'm so disappointed, I'll either send this back or drops it in the spares drawer.Pros: Ambidextrous, color change LED. (Those might be pros for you, I don't care about that, so doesn't matter for my purposes.)Cons: Awful settings by default, so you need to install their bloatware crap software to use it. The thumb buttons are too far back. Smaller and lighter than I expected, so feels basic.By awful settings, I mean it's got a couple of quirks that frustrate me. For example, in Windows I like to grab a window by the menu bar and drag it over to the next monitor. This mouse has a LOT of resistance when hitting the edge of the screen, so either it doesn't go to the next monitor at all (so stays on the same screen as a half-maximize) or I need to whip the mouse back and fourth a couple of times to \"hit\" the edge hard enough. That's hard to explain, so I hope I did it justice, but in short, something that I used to do in a half second without thinking about it is now 10 seconds of aggravation.Another awful setting I've found is playing an FPS game. With my old Logitech, I could turn left and right smoothly and could control it easily. With this Viper it feels heavy like it doesn't want to turn, so I move my mouse several inches then it suddenly \"whips\" around to a 180. It's clearly some sort of spring-loaded action that might be neat if I only gamed in straight hallways and wanted it to force me to do 180s. But since I play a game where I want to look left and right... It's awful.The thumb buttons are too far back. And not by a little bit. On my old Logitech the thumb buttons were, well, right under my thumb. On this one I have to hunt for it, and it's so far back I basically have to curl my thumb back to the knuckle, or pick up my hand from the mouse to move it back. It's uncomfortable enough that I'm not going to use that feature, and it's one of my requirements for a mouse.But the kicker for me; the thing that made me write this review and start the hunt for a different mouse is the software. It's not clear from the description that \"Razer wants you to use the hardware their way, or you can install software to configure it. Oh, the software comes with strings attached.\"I started to say \"maybe it's not bad, I'll give it a shot\" but I'm one of those people who reads EULA agreements. The Razer Synapse software gives them permission to monitor your computer. That's your system, the software you have installed, \"personal and other information\" etc. Oh, they also share that data with Google. And it requires the use of third party software that is no longer supported (a security no-no) and they take no responsibility for what happens with that. And maybe you think \"they can't sell my information, that's illegal\" - well, you'd need to check the laws of Singapore, as that's the governing laws you need to agree to.I did some searching to see if others has found a way around these dealbreakers for me, and did not find any. I did find some complaints that it looks like it requires you to log into a cloud service (to use your mouse) which is another dealbreaker for me.If you have small hands and RGB is more important to you than these issues, then this is perfect!"}

Honestly I assumed I'd get this mouse and be underwhelmed.so far, it's been about 2 weeks. this mouse is ultra light to me coming from a steelseries rival 600. the steelseries was slightly over 100 grams so it's almost 30 gram difference. this weighing in at 74. I didn't really expect it to affect my or even be noticeable. boy was I wrong. instantly lighter and the feet on this mouse glide so smoothly.very responsive and quick. thought I may have to turn down my dpi or sens due to how much lighter and smoother the razer is. However, from that heavier steelseries with weaker glide, to this much lighter exponentially better gliding 8k, it was seamless. adjusted extremely quickly.The shape is great feels great in my hand. did take me a minute to get used to as far as that goes simply because my last mouse was bulky and an unorthodox shape compared to most gaming mice. Now due to that there was some weird stress, and fatigue that presented in my forearm. again it adjusted quickly. after, at max, a couple 3-4 hour sessions it was gone. There are 4 total side buttons, but theres a caveat there I'll touch on later.the wire on this is absolutely perfect. 0 drag, dont even notice it's there until I look down. dont have to use my cord bungee either. I almost got the viper ult but knowing how this mouse feels, it would've been a waste of money to me.As great as this mouse is there are a couple trade offs and things I didnt know. these are not in number of importance.1) since this is ambidextrous, theres 4 total side buttons, one set on each side. Coming from a mouse with 3 side buttons and the way I had things mapped, I assumed I would be able to map all 4 buttons. wrong. the buttons are M4/M5 on each side. you have to choose if you are right or left handed in the app and that sets which side is being used and how they're numbered. kind of a bummer here but this is a personal issue not necessarily reflective of razer. coming from more to less is situational. I would just like that extra personalization.2) The 8k polling rate. this provides an extremely smooth mouse movement. this may be different from person to person. maybe mouse pads make a huge difference I have a relatively cheap one atm. One issue I've run into is Apex legends WILL NOT run a polling rate over 2000 on a 144 hz monitor. or at least not on mine. rainbow six siege I can crank to 8k and no issues. so maybe its game/display/system dependent I dont have a way to test it.3) I'm a person who enjoys rgb and wish there was more. this is a non issue for most I'm sure, but this is about the only thing the steelseries had over this mouse was the customization options for rgb.4) the liftoff distance. this is the number one win for steelseries. they had a liftoff distance as low as .5 mm lift off distance which I absolutely loved. the lowest for this mouse is 2 mm. so lifting and lowering there is mouse jottering I'm not a fan of but overall not a big issue. big win for steelseries here.Barring any huge issues this is a mouse I would 100 percent recommend at time of this review. buy it, check it out. I doubt you'll be disappointed!"}

I bought and returned multiple different mice before settling on this one, and after a couple of fails, I decided I'd go open box in case of more side buttons being unreachable or ergo shapes being uncomfortable, or whatever and having to return them. Anyway, I got this 8k for about $26. It arrived in resealed original packaging with no accessories or anything, which is fine at half price. It also came smelling like sanitized chemicals, and had tiny tannish food scraps or something in the rubberized side grip. A little rubbing alcohol and it was new again. After cleaning it, I used it for different things including web browsing, Android Studio, Blender, and Fortnite. The buttons have the greatest click I've ever felt, the scroll wheel is large and protrusive and has distinct notches as you roll it, which is made for FPS games like Fortnite, PUBG etc, for precise item selection, but would be annoying for some things which require smoother scrolling. The scroll click is easy and precise. . . the whole thing feels like a whole different level in feel and quality, from other mouse scroll wheels. I use the inside thumb buttons for jump and slide in Fortnite, and I disabled the left hand thumb buttons, which surprisingly, I don't feel, when my third finger rests there. I had to get used to the low profile of the thumb buttons, but once I adjusted to them, they actually work very well. Ergonomically, I prefer a hump towards the rear of the mouse, but my hand adjusted to that too. The 8k feature is wasted on me, because most lower-middle end PCs can't handle 8000 reports per second from the mouse, but the 1k setting is perfect. Everything from the PTFE skates to the Razer Focus+ sensor to the optical v2 switches is premium and frankly amazing for the price (which I paid half of.) Also, other than some of the $150ish Asus ROG mice, the Razer optical switch mice, like the Viper 8k, have hot-swappable switches, so if one of the top switches breaks, it's about $10-15 a pair to replace em and they just clip into place. . . no soldering. So, I really love this mouse, and I can't really recommend anything other than a Razer, after trying different mice. Its just different, unique and better. Apparently, from reviews I've seen, the other Razer mice have a smoother scroll wheel, for a less gamer specific, more universal functionality."}

I'm so disappointed, I'll either send this back or drops it in the spares drawer.Pros: Ambidextrous, color change LED. (Those might be pros for you, I don't care about that, so doesn't matter for my purposes.)Cons: Awful settings by default, so you need to install their bloatware crap software to use it. The thumb buttons are too far back. Smaller and lighter than I expected, so feels basic.By awful settings, I mean it's got a couple of quirks that frustrate me. For example, in Windows I like to grab a window by the menu bar and drag it over to the next monitor. This mouse has a LOT of resistance when hitting the edge of the screen, so either it doesn't go to the next monitor at all (so stays on the same screen as a half-maximize) or I need to whip the mouse back and fourth a couple of times to \"hit\" the edge hard enough. That's hard to explain, so I hope I did it justice, but in short, something that I used to do in a half second without thinking about it is now 10 seconds of aggravation.Another awful setting I've found is playing an FPS game. With my old Logitech, I could turn left and right smoothly and could control it easily. With this Viper it feels heavy like it doesn't want to turn, so I move my mouse several inches then it suddenly \"whips\" around to a 180. It's clearly some sort of spring-loaded action that might be neat if I only gamed in straight hallways and wanted it to force me to do 180s. But since I play a game where I want to look left and right... It's awful.The thumb buttons are too far back. And not by a little bit. On my old Logitech the thumb buttons were, well, right under my thumb. On this one I have to hunt for it, and it's so far back I basically have to curl my thumb back to the knuckle, or pick up my hand from the mouse to move it back. It's uncomfortable enough that I'm not going to use that feature, and it's one of my requirements for a mouse.But the kicker for me; the thing that made me write this review and start the hunt for a different mouse is the software. It's not clear from the description that \"Razer wants you to use the hardware their way, or you can install software to configure it. Oh, the software comes with strings attached.\"I started to say \"maybe it's not bad, I'll give it a shot\" but I'm one of those people who reads EULA agreements. The Razer Synapse software gives them permission to monitor your computer. That's your system, the software you have installed, \"personal and other information\" etc. Oh, they also share that data with Google. And it requires the use of third party software that is no longer supported (a security no-no) and they take no responsibility for what happens with that. And maybe you think \"they can't sell my information, that's illegal\" - well, you'd need to check the laws of Singapore, as that's the governing laws you need to agree to.I did some searching to see if others has found a way around these dealbreakers for me, and did not find any. I did find some complaints that it looks like it requires you to log into a cloud service (to use your mouse) which is another dealbreaker for me.If you have small hands and RGB is more important to you than these issues, then this is perfect!"}

Honestly I assumed I'd get this mouse and be underwhelmed.so far, it's been about 2 weeks. this mouse is ultra light to me coming from a steelseries rival 600. the steelseries was slightly over 100 grams so it's almost 30 gram difference. this weighing in at 74. I didn't really expect it to affect my or even be noticeable. boy was I wrong. instantly lighter and the feet on this mouse glide so smoothly.very responsive and quick. thought I may have to turn down my dpi or sens due to how much lighter and smoother the razer is. However, from that heavier steelseries with weaker glide, to this much lighter exponentially better gliding 8k, it was seamless. adjusted extremely quickly.The shape is great feels great in my hand. did take me a minute to get used to as far as that goes simply because my last mouse was bulky and an unorthodox shape compared to most gaming mice. Now due to that there was some weird stress, and fatigue that presented in my forearm. again it adjusted quickly. after, at max, a couple 3-4 hour sessions it was gone. There are 4 total side buttons, but theres a caveat there I'll touch on later.the wire on this is absolutely perfect. 0 drag, dont even notice it's there until I look down. dont have to use my cord bungee either. I almost got the viper ult but knowing how this mouse feels, it would've been a waste of money to me.As great as this mouse is there are a couple trade offs and things I didnt know. these are not in number of importance.1) since this is ambidextrous, theres 4 total side buttons, one set on each side. Coming from a mouse with 3 side buttons and the way I had things mapped, I assumed I would be able to map all 4 buttons. wrong. the buttons are M4/M5 on each side. you have to choose if you are right or left handed in the app and that sets which side is being used and how they're numbered. kind of a bummer here but this is a personal issue not necessarily reflective of razer. coming from more to less is situational. I would just like that extra personalization.2) The 8k polling rate. this provides an extremely smooth mouse movement. this may be different from person to person. maybe mouse pads make a huge difference I have a relatively cheap one atm. One issue I've run into is Apex legends WILL NOT run a polling rate over 2000 on a 144 hz monitor. or at least not on mine. rainbow six siege I can crank to 8k and no issues. so maybe its game/display/system dependent I dont have a way to test it.3) I'm a person who enjoys rgb and wish there was more. this is a non issue for most I'm sure, but this is about the only thing the steelseries had over this mouse was the customization options for rgb.4) the liftoff distance. this is the number one win for steelseries. they had a liftoff distance as low as .5 mm lift off distance which I absolutely loved. the lowest for this mouse is 2 mm. so lifting and lowering there is mouse jottering I'm not a fan of but overall not a big issue. big win for steelseries here.Barring any huge issues this is a mouse I would 100 percent recommend at time of this review. buy it, check it out. I doubt you'll be disappointed!"}

The main hype point is the 8KHz function which I never really used.It has I think up to 5 dpi profiles but once again, I set my preferred DPI and never touched the switch button again. Even if you need to switch it, the button is right below the mouse and is very inconvenient to use.Over these few years I've come across several games that did not recognize the side buttons at all. It was frustrating and rendered the mouse mostly \"useless\".Quality wise, the scroll wheel on mine is unusable. It erratically jumps up and down regardless of what side I'm scrolling. It is frustrating because I older mouse was some cheap one which I used way more but which up to this day works flawlessly.Sometimes the app doesn't switch the mode to normal after I quit the game. Switching manually doesn't really help so I have yo open a game and close it again.If you take those factors into account Viper is on the same level as any 20-30$ mouse. It was a nice experience but I won't be buying another one.Original review.Honestly, this mouse is very good, I like all aspects of it. Build quality is great; plastic is good and your hand doesn't slide on it, rubber provides extra grip. All buttons have pretty short travel time and are very responsive. Cable is long and sturdy, some people say it's too long, but in my opinion it's better to have long cable but not use all of it rather than have short cable and have to adapt for it's shortness.Side buttons are mirrored, so instead of button 4,5,6,7 there are 2 button 4 and 2 button 5, I didn't know and wasn't expecting that. Side buttons can be turned off on each side if you want it, but if you want to use them all, I'd recommend assigning buttons to respective key bindings cos otherwise you'll have 2 buttons doing same thing.There's nothing to say about RGB lighting because the only RGB part on the mouse is being covered by your palm and you never see it.One downside of side buttons is that if you want to use them all, those that are on the opposite side of your thumb will be tricky to use. Probably the biggest downside of this mouse is the lack of button on mouse itself to change mouse profiles; you should either open Synapse app and change it from there or assign one of the buttons for itViper got a vast DPI range and it's fully customizable. You manually choose DPI level from 100 to 20000 with 50 increments, although I can't even imagine what kind of person would use 20k DPI. You can also set DPI stages from 2 to 5 with entirely customizable sensitivity levels.As for 8KHz polling rate, it's kind of ahead of it's time. I tested in several different games, and most of them do NOT support such high polling rates. Usually its 2KHz, so far only BF4 was able to hold more than that - 4KHz. In strategy games polling rate didn't seem to matter at all, it was all the same in 2KHz and 8KHz."}

It can save dps setting on board the mouse, but THIS IS CRUCIAL, all 5 dps settings must be selected and then saved on the mouse. Ex. 800, 1000, 1200, 1600, 1800 it will then use these without the software running. COLOR SETTINGS, AND THEMES WILL NOT SAVE! THESE ONLY WORK IF SYNAPSE SOFWARE IS LOADED! If the software is not loaded it will default to factory settings. I learned this from a Reddit post, no where on the Razer site is this explained.

The main hype point is the 8KHz function which I never really used.It has I think up to 5 dpi profiles but once again, I set my preferred DPI and never touched the switch button again. Even if you need to switch it, the button is right below the mouse and is very inconvenient to use.Over these few years I've come across several games that did not recognize the side buttons at all. It was frustrating and rendered the mouse mostly \"useless\".Quality wise, the scroll wheel on mine is unusable. It erratically jumps up and down regardless of what side I'm scrolling. It is frustrating because I older mouse was some cheap one which I used way more but which up to this day works flawlessly.Sometimes the app doesn't switch the mode to normal after I quit the game. Switching manually doesn't really help so I have yo open a game and close it again.If you take those factors into account Viper is on the same level as any 20-30$ mouse. It was a nice experience but I won't be buying another one.Original review.Honestly, this mouse is very good, I like all aspects of it. Build quality is great; plastic is good and your hand doesn't slide on it, rubber provides extra grip. All buttons have pretty short travel time and are very responsive. Cable is long and sturdy, some people say it's too long, but in my opinion it's better to have long cable but not use all of it rather than have short cable and have to adapt for it's shortness.Side buttons are mirrored, so instead of button 4,5,6,7 there are 2 button 4 and 2 button 5, I didn't know and wasn't expecting that. Side buttons can be turned off on each side if you want it, but if you want to use them all, I'd recommend assigning buttons to respective key bindings cos otherwise you'll have 2 buttons doing same thing.There's nothing to say about RGB lighting because the only RGB part on the mouse is being covered by your palm and you never see it.One downside of side buttons is that if you want to use them all, those that are on the opposite side of your thumb will be tricky to use. Probably the biggest downside of this mouse is the lack of button on mouse itself to change mouse profiles; you should either open Synapse app and change it from there or assign one of the buttons for itViper got a vast DPI range and it's fully customizable. You manually choose DPI level from 100 to 20000 with 50 increments, although I can't even imagine what kind of person would use 20k DPI. You can also set DPI stages from 2 to 5 with entirely customizable sensitivity levels.As for 8KHz polling rate, it's kind of ahead of it's time. I tested in several different games, and most of them do NOT support such high polling rates. Usually its 2KHz, so far only BF4 was able to hold more than that - 4KHz. In strategy games polling rate didn't seem to matter at all, it was all the same in 2KHz and 8KHz."}

Tracking is smooth as butter - I don't go anywhere near to top range of 30,000 DPI. Your hand on the mouse is well supported and comfortable. I game as well as work AutoCAD and Modelling and this mouse has been fantastic. I can now see WHY people pay the premium but, if you have the chance to get a lower priced used one - go for it. Oh yea, forgot to mention...had I not know it was used, I'd never have guessed it.

{"asin": "B0B6XZLNHQ", "username": "Charlie Liu", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nBy far the best mouse I've ever used", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2023", "purchased": "Style: WirelessColor: White", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "As a gamer, I've owned and used many different computer mice.  I usually look through some of the best mice money can buy, then compare them with less expensive or no-name brands and see what the differences are.  Most of the time, it's just marketing jargons that pollutes the ad, making things seem better than they are.After some pretty extensive research, I purchased this Razer V3 Deathadder Pro and the Logitech G Pro Superlight gaming mouse - both of which stands at the very top of the food chain for gaming mice and are about the same price.  Both of these mice are used by professional gamers (depending on which sponsors they're with), and both are extremely light.  They both come in white with no RGB, and they also both taunt an outrageously high DPI that literally no one uses.  At a glance, both are very comparable in everyway - which I assume you know this if you're looking to buy a mouse this expensive.The Razer V3 DA Pro has much better optimizations in the Synapse software, and while some other reviewers have had issues, my windows 10 and 11 devices all run Synapse perfectly.  The mouse comes with a dongle that you can plug the wireless USB piece into, which allows for a better connection to the mouse when there is less space.  Even with RF, the signal deteriorates after the first foot or so.  As such, I leave my mouse and dongle fairly close to each other.  The Logitech software, however, is a total mess and I find it very difficult to navigate.  The software also crashes pretty often with Logitech, which has not been an issue with Razer Synapse.  Neither of these mice have a DPI button on top, but both allow for customization in the software.  The Razer DA V3P has a DPI button that allows you to cycle through the preset DPI options, which I'm glad they've put it on the bottom as I have only accidentally ever hit that on the other mice I use.  The Logitech does not have a DPI button at all, but you could configure the side buttons.  I use 800 DPI all around and never change it, so it does not affect me either way.I think for most people, ergonomics is what really determines the purchase but it's hard to describe ergonomics to someone who has never held either of these mice.  If you have used a Razer Deathadder V2, the previous version, you'll find that the V3 is a completely different feel and design - for the better, at least for me.  The Logitech is comfortable, but the Razer feels like an ergo mouse even though it isn't designed as one.Razer's advertising for this mouse is a little misleading.  The mouse has a standard polling rate of 1k hz, but with a 40 dollar adapter, you can get a 4k hz polling rate.  This is not an option at all with Logitech, as the mouse only has the 1k hz polling rate with no upgrades.Both mice have great skates to help with sliding, and in combination with the super lightweight, it feels even lighter than it is.  I did weigh both mice and found that the G Pro is about 5 grams lighter - this is not detectable by my hands when I'm using it.If battery life is important to you, I find both mouse lasts for quite some time even though I'm constantly using them.  Razer advertises a slightly longer battery life, and I find that to be mostly true.  What Razer doesn't advertise is their charging speeds, as it is in fact much faster than Logitech.  You can use either mouse while it's plugged in when they are charging.If you're getting the white variant of either mice, just know that the tape/grip comes only in black."}

The shape and performance are unmatched.And yet, I returned it as it wasn't for me. Don't get me wrong its a great mouse and perfect for larger handed players looking for a proper ergo mouse. The clicks were great and if you can get your hands on the 4k dongle, it has the best 4k performance on the market. But what didn't work for me was the coating. Razer's mice have the worst coating I have ever felt. It is a weird, almost \"chalky\" feeling that is just too slippery in my hands. I'm used to the GPX coating and it is great or even better Pulsar's latest releases or even the latest Lamzu release. Those companies have it figured out and dare I say come close to matching one of the best coatings, the xm1r from EGG.But with Razer it is the polar opposite, it just doesn't work for me at all and I can't get a grip on it. Just goes to show that regardless of the tech specs and even the shape, if something like the coating isn't great then it ruins the mouse. Now some might find it works good for them and that is fine, but it just didn't work for me.However, I have heard that the lastest Faker editon of this mouse has a different newer coating that isn't the same and is more in line with something I'm looking for. Might have to try that out myself sometime. Honestly, if you're someone who likes the coating of the GPX or any of the other mice I mentioned, go for the Faker edition instead."}

It cost less than $80, so I won't go into the value for the money at all with this review. That said, I got a perfect example for that cost.This mouse has been on my radar for a while. When I saw I could get it cheap, I had to pick it up. The feel in hand is fantastic for an ergo mouse. I prefer smaller mice, and I fingertip grip with my wrist anchored on my mousepad. With that grip, it makes contact with the pad right under my knuckles, which is where I like my mouse to give support. There's plenty of support for my ring and pinky finger as well, so they don't have to be tucked in or dragged on the mousepad. This mouse does feel large in the hand, but surprisingly light for its size. For reference, my main mouse is the Viper Mini Signature Edition. I still prefer the mini, but there's no denying that this mouse is comfortable.For palm grip, my fingers go a bit further on the mouse than I'd like, but it's still OK. Claw grip doesn't seem to work as well on this mouse for me as it does on ambi mice.The buttons are all great. I'm used to the Razer optical switches, and they feel well implemented on this mouse. The side buttons also are fantastic, without any wobble, pre, or post travel. The scroll wheel is a bit of a letdown though. It scrolls very easily, but without well defined stops, so you can easily accidentally scroll or over scroll. The scroll click is nice and light, but I find that I accidentally scroll when trying to click it.Build quality is solid. There no creaking or popping when exerting pressure on the mouse, no flex to speak of either. For what they're asking I'd expect this, but it's good that it lives up to it.If you can get a good deal on this mouse, I'd say go for it. Amazon's used mice have been a bit of a crap shoot for me. I got one that didn't have a receiver dongle, one that didn't have skates, and now this one, which is perfect. I'd say take the risk, you can always return it if you don't get what you're expecting!"}

I have large hands and this mouse is for large hands. Large hands meaning big width and long fingers. For example the Logitech g pro wireless I consider 'small' for myself. Take that into account.Razer is on absolute fire recently with their gaming mice department. I do not know if they got some type of freedom from their old product manager or got their own factory - who knows. All we know is they have been taking feedback and releasing exactly what the community is asking for and the products are FIRE.The Razer Deathadder v3 pro talks for itself, the biggest change for those who actually used the Deathadder is the mouse has reduced the flares on the left/right, and moved the hump more center instead of back. It is still ergonomic for sure but feels more similar to ambidextrous now. The best part is you can FULLY extend your ring finger comfortably across the right-side of the mouse. Your pinky has room as well and does not need to touch the mouse pad.The thumb buttons have been raised so your thumb has full extension access as well with zero contact to the thumb buttons. PERFECT. The mouse has great contact with the underside of your knuckle and some small contact with the palm.Besides the shape which is generally the most important part in deciding to buy a mouse the rest of the mouse is what I would call 'flawless'Sensor - Perfect tracking, zero sensor malfunction, zero jitter, zero +/- acceleration. (Side note, I have not tested 4000hz mode and while I am sure it is great I will be using it in 1000hz mode for longer battery life. I am older now and do not compete like I used to, 1000hz works perfectly fine for me).Coating (White version) - Absolutely wonderful, easy to grip, feels great in handMain clicks - Perfect, split trigger design, amazing actuation force feeling. No complaintsSide Buttons - Perfect, love the size and placement as wellScroll Wheel - It works, doesn't feel great, doesn't feel bad, feels good. I use it for jump in-game zero issuesWeight - Seriously. It's a large ergo mouse in the 63-64g range.. It's LIGHTBattery life - Haven't tested it yet but I am sure it's fine, running it in 1000hz mode.USB-C Connectivity - Great. Modern standards. Love itCable - They provided a lightweight usb-c cable for the receiver which is also used to charge the mouse, if you did have to run it in wired it is actually a great cable as well.Mouse Feet - Perfect glide zero issues on my endOverall for a large hand gaming who was seeking a wireless option. The Razer Deathadder v3 pro is the best thing I have ever graced my hands on. Tested it for several hours and after a quick muscle memory adjustment I was not only aiming fantastically (which I can do on several mice) but I was also comfortable. Comfort being the most important factor for me.The large size and lightweight also makes micro-tracking/adjustments even easier to do. I was using the G703 prior and it was do-able but fatigue hit sooner and it felt like a lot of effort sometimes to track something that was spinning around you (this is less an issue in tactical games like Counter-strike and Valorant, and more for fast paced games with a lot of tracking think Quake Live and Overwatch).The entire team that developed this product. I really wish I was in your industry - I would be absolutely proud to have released such a top-tier gaming product. The market of large hand competitive gamers were requesting this and it has been delivered. Beat both Logitech and Zowie to market which is incredible. Give yourself a pat on the back.

When my opinions inevitably change, I will update the review. Edit: So far, I continue to really like the mouse. No new issues and it has replaced the Model D as my primary mouse.First, $150 is too much. You know it and I know it, but we buy it anyway, so they keep doing it. It is double the price of a Glorious Model D Wireless and it is not double the mouse. BUT let's move on to actually talking about the mouse.It's not the same shape as the old Deathadder. The flares are gone, it's overall skinnier, and the top is less flat. It's much closer to something like the Model D than the Deathadder at this point, though the Model D is still flatter on top. I kinda miss the flares, personally, as I could push my ring finger up against the right one for extra grip when lifting. This is much more of a hybrid grip kinda mouse whereas the old one was definitely a palm grip mouse. They also did away with the rubber grips (or any rubberized feeling at all), though they have included grip tape for people like myself who like it. Unfortunately, that tape is black, so if you get the white mouse, it's kinda ugly. Finally, the side buttons are moved slightly up and toward the back of the mouse, which I find better than the previous design.They shaved quite a lot of weight off the mouse and the result is that it sounds quite hollow. While I commend them for not putting holes in the mouse, the benefit of having holes is that sound doesn't bounce around inside the mouse, so it doesn't sound hollow. The main clicks are no longer part of the top shell but instead are separate pieces of plastic. I imagine this was done because the old ones felt like mushy crap. These feel great, though I imagine some people will find them a bit too heavy. I have a tendency to accidentally click, so these work for me. The middle click and side clicks all have a similar actuation force, so it's nice to have that consistency. Finally, the mouse wheel feels smoother than the old one when scrolling, closer to the Model D but still a little bit more distinct (which I like).The stock mouse feet are SLICK. I am not a competitive gamer, so I have never bothered to use any particularly fancy feet (though I did put the Tiger ICE on both the DA v2 Pro and the Viper Ultimate), but these are much slicker than I am used to. It feels almost like going from 800 to 900 or even 1000 DPI, I just don't feel as in control. However, over the course of a week or so, I have gotten used to them and for people who like that sort of thing in the first place, this will be a feature rather than a bug. Just something to be aware of.Finally, they removed RGB, Bluetooth, and charging dock capabilities. While I do like RGB, I didn't like that it required Synapse to work properly, so it's a net win for me. I set up my profile and now I can just ignore Synapse forever, hooray! Bluetooth sucks for a mouse, really, so that's no real loss. And the charging dock... I never had issues with it on the DA v2 Pro, but it was a bit more finnicky with the Viper Ultimate, perhaps because of the lighter weight. The tradeoff is that it now uses USB-C AND the opening is wide enough to accommodate the magnetic charging cable I've been using (the old designs were not), so I haven't really lost anything there.So, to summarize. Should you buy this mouse? It's a solid ergo shape, it's light, the clicks feel good, it has low latency, it's immune to double-clicking issues, it has one of the best sensors on the market, it basically doesn't need Synapse for anything, and it's overall just a really good mouse. But it's also $150 and that makes it very hard to recommend. But if you can hold out for a sale (or just have money to blow), absolutely get it."}

Well, I got it and was shocked at how feather lite it is when you pick it up, it almost seems wrong! Loaded up Synapse and in a few minutes, the mouse was mousing. Tracking is smooth as butter - I don't go anywhere near to top range of 30,000 DPI. Your hand on the mouse is well supported and comfortable. I game as well as work AutoCAD and Modelling and this mouse has been fantastic. I can now see WHY people pay the premium but, if you have the chance to get a lower priced used one - go for it. Oh yea, forgot to mention...had I not know it was used, I'd never have guessed it. The thing came out of the box looking perfectly brand new, not a single blemish on it and the pads were completely scratch free! So literally...the thing was new for better than 1/2 the cost. Give it a shot, from someone who uses a mouse all day for work, then games in the evening - I give it 5 stars with no hesitation aside from the steep cost they demand for it!"}

I usually look through some of the best mice money can buy, then compare them with less expensive or no-name brands and see what the differences are.  Most of the time, it's just marketing jargons that pollutes the ad, making things seem better than they are.After some pretty extensive research, I purchased this Razer V3 Deathadder Pro and the Logitech G Pro Superlight gaming mouse - both of which stands at the very top of the food chain for gaming mice and are about the same price.  Both of these mice are used by professional gamers (depending on which sponsors they're with), and both are extremely light.  They both come in white with no RGB, and they also both taunt an outrageously high DPI that literally no one uses.  At a glance, both are very comparable in everyway - which I assume you know this if you're looking to buy a mouse this expensive.The Razer V3 DA Pro has much better optimizations in the Synapse software, and while some other reviewers have had issues, my windows 10 and 11 devices all run Synapse perfectly.  The mouse comes with a dongle that you can plug the wireless USB piece into, which allows for a better connection to the mouse when there is less space.  Even with RF, the signal deteriorates after the first foot or so.  As such, I leave my mouse and dongle fairly close to each other.  The Logitech software, however, is a total mess and I find it very difficult to navigate.  The software also crashes pretty often with Logitech, which has not been an issue with Razer Synapse.  Neither of these mice have a DPI button on top, but both allow for customization in the software.  The Razer DA V3P has a DPI button that allows you to cycle through the preset DPI options, which I'm glad they've put it on the bottom as I have only accidentally ever hit that on the other mice I use.  The Logitech does not have a DPI button at all, but you could configure the side buttons.  I use 800 DPI all around and never change it, so it does not affect me either way.I think for most people, ergonomics is what really determines the purchase but it's hard to describe ergonomics to someone who has never held either of these mice.  If you have used a Razer Deathadder V2, the previous version, you'll find that the V3 is a completely different feel and design - for the better, at least for me.  The Logitech is comfortable, but the Razer feels like an ergo mouse even though it isn't designed as one.Razer's advertising for this mouse is a little misleading.  The mouse has a standard polling rate of 1k hz, but with a 40 dollar adapter, you can get a 4k hz polling rate.  This is not an option at all with Logitech, as the mouse only has the 1k hz polling rate with no upgrades.Both mice have great skates to help with sliding, and in combination with the super lightweight, it feels even lighter than it is.  I did weigh both mice and found that the G Pro is about 5 grams lighter - this is not detectable by my hands when I'm using it.If battery life is important to you, I find both mouse lasts for quite some time even though I'm constantly using them.  Razer advertises a slightly longer battery life, and I find that to be mostly true.  What Razer doesn't advertise is their charging speeds, as it is in fact much faster than Logitech.  You can use either mouse while it's plugged in when they are charging.If you're getting the white variant of either mice, just know that the tape/grip comes only in black."}

The shape and performance are unmatched.And yet, I returned it as it wasn't for me. Don't get me wrong its a great mouse and perfect for larger handed players looking for a proper ergo mouse. The clicks were great and if you can get your hands on the 4k dongle, it has the best 4k performance on the market. But what didn't work for me was the coating. Razer's mice have the worst coating I have ever felt. It is a weird, almost \"chalky\" feeling that is just too slippery in my hands. I'm used to the GPX coating and it is great or even better Pulsar's latest releases or even the latest Lamzu release. Those companies have it figured out and dare I say come close to matching one of the best coatings, the xm1r from EGG.But with Razer it is the polar opposite, it just doesn't work for me at all and I can't get a grip on it. Just goes to show that regardless of the tech specs and even the shape, if something like the coating isn't great then it ruins the mouse. Now some might find it works good for them and that is fine, but it just didn't work for me.However, I have heard that the lastest Faker editon of this mouse has a different newer coating that isn't the same and is more in line with something I'm looking for. Might have to try that out myself sometime. Honestly, if you're someone who likes the coating of the GPX or any of the other mice I mentioned, go for the Faker edition instead."}

It cost less than $80, so I won't go into the value for the money at all with this review. That said, I got a perfect example for that cost.This mouse has been on my radar for a while. When I saw I could get it cheap, I had to pick it up. The feel in hand is fantastic for an ergo mouse. I prefer smaller mice, and I fingertip grip with my wrist anchored on my mousepad. With that grip, it makes contact with the pad right under my knuckles, which is where I like my mouse to give support. There's plenty of support for my ring and pinky finger as well, so they don't have to be tucked in or dragged on the mousepad. This mouse does feel large in the hand, but surprisingly light for its size. For reference, my main mouse is the Viper Mini Signature Edition. I still prefer the mini, but there's no denying that this mouse is comfortable.For palm grip, my fingers go a bit further on the mouse than I'd like, but it's still OK. Claw grip doesn't seem to work as well on this mouse for me as it does on ambi mice.The buttons are all great. I'm used to the Razer optical switches, and they feel well implemented on this mouse. The side buttons also are fantastic, without any wobble, pre, or post travel. The scroll wheel is a bit of a letdown though. It scrolls very easily, but without well defined stops, so you can easily accidentally scroll or over scroll. The scroll click is nice and light, but I find that I accidentally scroll when trying to click it.Build quality is solid. There no creaking or popping when exerting pressure on the mouse, no flex to speak of either. For what they're asking I'd expect this, but it's good that it lives up to it.If you can get a good deal on this mouse, I'd say go for it. Amazon's used mice have been a bit of a crap shoot for me. I got one that didn't have a receiver dongle, one that didn't have skates, and now this one, which is perfect. I'd say take the risk, you can always return it if you don't get what you're expecting!"}

I have large hands and this mouse is for large hands. Large hands meaning big width and long fingers. For example the Logitech g pro wireless I consider 'small' for myself. Take that into account.Razer is on absolute fire recently with their gaming mice department. I do not know if they got some type of freedom from their old product manager or got their own factory - who knows. All we know is they have been taking feedback and releasing exactly what the community is asking for and the products are FIRE.The Razer Deathadder v3 pro talks for itself, the biggest change for those who actually used the Deathadder is the mouse has reduced the flares on the left/right, and moved the hump more center instead of back. It is still ergonomic for sure but feels more similar to ambidextrous now. The best part is you can FULLY extend your ring finger comfortably across the right-side of the mouse. Your pinky has room as well and does not need to touch the mouse pad.The thumb buttons have been raised so your thumb has full extension access as well with zero contact to the thumb buttons. PERFECT. The mouse has great contact with the underside of your knuckle and some small contact with the palm.Besides the shape which is generally the most important part in deciding to buy a mouse the rest of the mouse is what I would call 'flawless'Sensor - Perfect tracking, zero sensor malfunction, zero jitter, zero +/- acceleration. (Side note, I have not tested 4000hz mode and while I am sure it is great I will be using it in 1000hz mode for longer battery life. I am older now and do not compete like I used to, 1000hz works perfectly fine for me).Coating (White version) - Absolutely wonderful, easy to grip, feels great in handMain clicks - Perfect, split trigger design, amazing actuation force feeling. No complaintsSide Buttons - Perfect, love the size and placement as wellScroll Wheel - It works, doesn't feel great, doesn't feel bad, feels good. I use it for jump in-game zero issuesWeight - Seriously. It's a large ergo mouse in the 63-64g range.. It's LIGHTBattery life - Haven't tested it yet but I am sure it's fine, running it in 1000hz mode.USB-C Connectivity - Great. Modern standards. Love itCable - They provided a lightweight usb-c cable for the receiver which is also used to charge the mouse, if you did have to run it in wired it is actually a great cable as well.Mouse Feet - Perfect glide zero issues on my endOverall for a large hand gaming who was seeking a wireless option. The Razer Deathadder v3 pro is the best thing I have ever graced my hands on. Tested it for several hours and after a quick muscle memory adjustment I was not only aiming fantastically (which I can do on several mice) but I was also comfortable. Comfort being the most important factor for me.The large size and lightweight also makes micro-tracking/adjustments even easier to do. I was using the G703 prior and it was do-able but fatigue hit sooner and it felt like a lot of effort sometimes to track something that was spinning around you (this is less an issue in tactical games like Counter-strike and Valorant, and more for fast paced games with a lot of tracking think Quake Live and Overwatch).The entire team that developed this product. I really wish I was in your industry - I would be absolutely proud to have released such a top-tier gaming product. The market of large hand competitive gamers were requesting this and it has been delivered. Beat both Logitech and Zowie to market which is incredible. Give yourself a pat on the back. I bought two of these one for daily and one for backup. Razer be proud, I truly feel like this is a, 'For Gamers, By Gamers' product.Amazing, 10/10 product for me. Love it. If you're a daily G703 user like I was, your upgrade is here. Zero-regret purchase."}

However, over the course of a week or so, I have gotten used to them and for people who like that sort of thing in the first place, this will be a feature rather than a bug. Just something to be aware of.Finally, they removed RGB, Bluetooth, and charging dock capabilities. While I do like RGB, I didn't like that it required Synapse to work properly, so it's a net win for me. I set up my profile and now I can just ignore Synapse forever, hooray! Bluetooth sucks for a mouse, really, so that's no real loss. And the charging dock... I never had issues with it on the DA v2 Pro, but it was a bit more finnicky with the Viper Ultimate, perhaps because of the lighter weight. The tradeoff is that it now uses USB-C AND the opening is wide enough to accommodate the magnetic charging cable I've been using (the old designs were not), so I haven't really lost anything there.So, to summarize. Should you buy this mouse? It's a solid ergo shape, it's light, the clicks feel good, it has low latency, it's immune to double-clicking issues, it has one of the best sensors on the market, it basically doesn't need Synapse for anything, and it's overall just a really good mouse. But it's also $150 and that makes it very hard to recommend. But if you can hold out for a sale (or just have money to blow), absolutely get it."}

I am now on my fourth UHURU gaming mouse, with an order placed for a fifth as a backup. Like clockwork, these mice seem to last just over two years for me, with heavy every day use (12+ hours per day). This time, my third UHURU gaming mouse had one of the side buttons cave in, similar to my first one. I again could not be happier with my experience. For $20, you're getting an incredibly durable wireless mouse that has a very smooth feel, fits perfectly in the hand for someone with average or above average hand sizes, and looks amazing with that LED lighting and matte black casing.I can't give enough praise to UHURU for this mouse. Unless something drastically changes, I don't see myself ever using a different mouse at any point in the future. I don't think I've ever had this consistently positive of an experience with any other product on Amazon, this mouse is seriously incredible. I will be sure to come back in another two years with an update after I use my fourth UHURU gaming mouse to death.Second review:I reviewed this mouse two years ago, and had purchased it again to replace the original one I had because after two years of extensive use it finally had enough. Couldn’t have been happier with it. The replacement one I received also lasted two years for me, with extensive every day heavy gaming use. I literally use it actively for 12 hours a day or so, every day. Everything I do in life is from my computer, and this mouse has weathered that storm for two years on two separate occasions now. Last time one of the thumb buttons finally had caved in, this time it’s just slowly dying, randomly turning off while plugged in. Again, couldn’t be happier with how long it has lasted and how much it has endured. I cannot recommend this mouse enough for anyone out there, regardless of your situation. I have now ordered another one, and will update again in another two years!First review:This mouse is amazing, regardless of the price, but the price just makes it that much better. I purchased this mouse in January of 2018 and today, in April of 2020, it finally had its first problem. One of the side/thumb buttons caved in, basically, which is the result of heavy use over a long period of time. I have already placed an order for a new one, and my girlfriend is excited to use my old one since she doesn't use the side buttons and it still functions perfectly otherwise.It's hard for me to find wireless and comfortable gaming mice that have acceptable performance, but this one had it all. I can't tell the difference in delay between this wireless mouse and other wired mice. On top of it, it's very comfortable. I have a slightly above average hand size and with most mice it's hard for me to find a comfortable way to grip it and use it, but this mouse is the perfect size and I'm not having to stretch my fingers to reach any of the buttons, they're all in the perfect place. It's very responsive to movement, and unlike other wireless mice when it goes into power-save mode and you have to click to wake it up, it doesn't send a \"click\" command to the computer, so if it went into power-save mode while the cursor was over a button, it wouldn't click the button when I wake up the mouse, which brings me to its incredible battery life and charging speed. I thought for sure with the LED lights and low price the battery wouldn't last very long, but it lasts me multiple days on one charge before I need to recharge it. Then, when I need to charge it, I just plug it into my computer and it becomes a wired mouse for about 20 minutes and then it'll last me a couple more days with heavy use.The bottom line is that if you're looking for a great wireless gaming mouse at an affordable price, stop looking, you've found it. There's no reason not to get this mouse if you're a gamer. If you're not a gamer, there's probably cheaper mice out there that'll do what you need it to, but for gamers this is the perfect wireless mouse."}

Their customer service was top-notch and surprising because no other seller has contacted me to give their product a second chance. This mouse also has a 12-month warranty which I didn't know about.I'm really glad that I gave this mouse another shot! There is no lagging issue like the last one had. The previous mouse started lagging on the first day but I have been testing this mouse out for a few days now and there has been no sign of it.The battery life has lasted me a little over 24 hours. The scrolling wheel is smoother than the last one I had and it doesn't feel as cheaply made, like I can crush it in my hand. It actually feels like I got a completely different mouse than the one I purchased.All in all, I'm liking it so far.Original Review:The UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse has several issues that make it a difficult product to recommend. First and foremost, it has serious lagging issues that make it frustrating to use. It can be unresponsive and sluggish, which can be a significant problem for gamers who need precision and quick reflexes.The build quality of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse feels cheap and flimsy. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up over time, and it could easily break if not handled delicately. The buttons and scroll wheel don't have a satisfying tactile feel, which further contributes to the impression of a low-quality product.The battery life of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse is subpar, lasting only 3-4 hours on a single charge. This means that you'll need to keep it plugged in frequently, which can be inconvenient and frustrating.Despite these issues, it's worth noting that the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse does have one positive aspect: the changing colors are beautiful. If you prioritize aesthetics and want a mouse that looks good, then this mouse is for you.Overall, while the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse may look nice, it falls short in several important areas and may not be the best choice for most users. If you're in the market for a gaming mouse, there are better options available that provide better performance, build quality, and battery life."}

{"asin": "B071HVWD55", "username": "Spencer", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest Overall Mouse Out There", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2020", "purchased": "Color: black", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Third review:This is my third review of this mouse in six years. I am now on my fourth UHURU gaming mouse, with an order placed for a fifth as a backup. Like clockwork, these mice seem to last just over two years for me, with heavy every day use (12+ hours per day). This time, my third UHURU gaming mouse had one of the side buttons cave in, similar to my first one. I again could not be happier with my experience. For $20, you're getting an incredibly durable wireless mouse that has a very smooth feel, fits perfectly in the hand for someone with average or above average hand sizes, and looks amazing with that LED lighting and matte black casing.I can't give enough praise to UHURU for this mouse. Unless something drastically changes, I don't see myself ever using a different mouse at any point in the future. I don't think I've ever had this consistently positive of an experience with any other product on Amazon, this mouse is seriously incredible. I will be sure to come back in another two years with an update after I use my fourth UHURU gaming mouse to death.Second review:I reviewed this mouse two years ago, and had purchased it again to replace the original one I had because after two years of extensive use it finally had enough. Couldn’t have been happier with it. The replacement one I received also lasted two years for me, with extensive every day heavy gaming use. I literally use it actively for 12 hours a day or so, every day. Everything I do in life is from my computer, and this mouse has weathered that storm for two years on two separate occasions now. Last time one of the thumb buttons finally had caved in, this time it’s just slowly dying, randomly turning off while plugged in. Again, couldn’t be happier with how long it has lasted and how much it has endured. I cannot recommend this mouse enough for anyone out there, regardless of your situation. I have now ordered another one, and will update again in another two years!First review:This mouse is amazing, regardless of the price, but the price just makes it that much better. I purchased this mouse in January of 2018 and today, in April of 2020, it finally had its first problem. One of the side/thumb buttons caved in, basically, which is the result of heavy use over a long period of time. I have already placed an order for a new one, and my girlfriend is excited to use my old one since she doesn't use the side buttons and it still functions perfectly otherwise.It's hard for me to find wireless and comfortable gaming mice that have acceptable performance, but this one had it all. I can't tell the difference in delay between this wireless mouse and other wired mice. On top of it, it's very comfortable. I have a slightly above average hand size and with most mice it's hard for me to find a comfortable way to grip it and use it, but this mouse is the perfect size and I'm not having to stretch my fingers to reach any of the buttons, they're all in the perfect place. It's very responsive to movement, and unlike other wireless mice when it goes into power-save mode and you have to click to wake it up, it doesn't send a \"click\" command to the computer, so if it went into power-save mode while the cursor was over a button, it wouldn't click the button when I wake up the mouse, which brings me to its incredible battery life and charging speed. I thought for sure with the LED lights and low price the battery wouldn't last very long, but it lasts me multiple days on one charge before I need to recharge it. Then, when I need to charge it, I just plug it into my computer and it becomes a wired mouse for about 20 minutes and then it'll last me a couple more days with heavy use.The bottom line is that if you're looking for a great wireless gaming mouse at an affordable price, stop looking, you've found it. There's no reason not to get this mouse if you're a gamer. If you're not a gamer, there's probably cheaper mice out there that'll do what you need it to, but for gamers this is the perfect wireless mouse."}

Their customer service was top-notch and surprising because no other seller has contacted me to give their product a second chance. This mouse also has a 12-month warranty which I didn't know about.I'm really glad that I gave this mouse another shot! There is no lagging issue like the last one had. The previous mouse started lagging on the first day but I have been testing this mouse out for a few days now and there has been no sign of it.The battery life has lasted me a little over 24 hours. The scrolling wheel is smoother than the last one I had and it doesn't feel as cheaply made, like I can crush it in my hand. It actually feels like I got a completely different mouse than the one I purchased.All in all, I'm liking it so far.Original Review:The UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse has several issues that make it a difficult product to recommend. First and foremost, it has serious lagging issues that make it frustrating to use. It can be unresponsive and sluggish, which can be a significant problem for gamers who need precision and quick reflexes.The build quality of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse feels cheap and flimsy. It doesn't inspire confidence that it will hold up over time, and it could easily break if not handled delicately. The buttons and scroll wheel don't have a satisfying tactile feel, which further contributes to the impression of a low-quality product.The battery life of the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse is subpar, lasting only 3-4 hours on a single charge. This means that you'll need to keep it plugged in frequently, which can be inconvenient and frustrating.Despite these issues, it's worth noting that the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse does have one positive aspect: the changing colors are beautiful. If you prioritize aesthetics and want a mouse that looks good, then this mouse is for you.Overall, while the UHURU Wireless Gaming Mouse may look nice, it falls short in several important areas and may not be the best choice for most users. If you're in the market for a gaming mouse, there are better options available that provide better performance, build quality, and battery life."}

The mouse was really light, which was a downside for me since I prefer a more substantial feel for accurate control in games (I should have known this though because of the listing). Despite its excellent sensor and configurable buttons, I had trouble getting used to the weight, which affected how well I played games. I chose to give it to a close friend who shares my love of gaming rather than leave it unused in the hopes that it would better suit their playing style.My friend couldn't have been happier with the gaming mouse, much to my happy surprise. They noticed right away how light it was, allowing for quick and accurate movements throughout their gaming sessions. They were impressed with how much their gameplay was enhanced by the mouse's sensitive sensor and programmable buttons. It was certainly a case of the right mouse finding the right owner, and I was thrilled to see my present make my friend's gaming setup so much more enjoyable and perform better. It's not uncommon for something that doesn't work for one person to be the ideal fit for another; in this case, it was a situation where everyone won, which improved both of our gaming experiences."}

As stated on the product page itself, it's light and honeycombed, and has the standard 2 buttons on the side.The side buttons were placed in such a way that it's easy to accidentally hit them with your thumb just by squeezing the mouse slightly, which can happen pretty often. Given that some commonly used apps have functions unchangeably tied to these buttons, pressing them on accident gets frustrating at times.By default, the mouse wheel glows, constantly changing color. If you have it in a space that needs to have little to no light, this might be an issue. There's probably a way to change it through some dedicated HyperX software but I wasn't bothered by the light. What I was bothered by, however, is that the wheel may scroll in the opposite direction (I scroll down, the page scrolls up, and vice versa). This is extremely problematic if you're doing something that needs you to be able to mouse scroll with precision, and I don't see a way to change this besides move the function to something else and set nothing on the wheel.All in all, I wouldn't call it better or worse than what I've previously used, and while I don't need to replace it, I still have enough reasons to do so if the opportunity presents itself."}

One thing I had a problem with other brands was the middle mouse button breaking on me after about 6 months of use, but this one feels solid and is still in working order.I’m also a huge fan of the lightweight honey comb feature, which also helps prevent your hand from sweating during extended gaming sessions. The program used to customize the lighting and set the DPI is very easy to use. I also like that it has different color codings for each DPI cycle. The size is also just right, I have medium-large hands, and it fits nice and comfortably in my hand.This is definitely a must-have mouse, and if it ever fails me, I will 100% buy another."}

The mouse buttons are way to easy to click. I find myself accidentally hitting the right button, even just skimming it while I am in the middle of working and it clicks it. Definitely needs to be a tougher click. Again, not a huge deal, but it is one I am experiencing now.ORIGINAL REVIEW:For the past two years I have been in search of a new mouse. I am willing to pay top dollar for it, since I will use it for years and it will help me with my video editing, graphic design, etc. BUT my issue is spending that money only to find out the mouse is crap and I have to return it, or I get lazy and don't and lose the money, etc etc.Right out of the gate I was loving it. The wire for this is more a silky cloth like coating. It does not catch on the edge of my desk and it is smooth enough that it does not give me any pull when I am using the mouse. (Where the rough rubber / plastic wires would catch on the edge and give me grief from time to time).The holes in the mouse are important. I work on videos and sometimes I am intensely editing and my hand gets moist, and sweaty and it makes the mouse feel weird. (That whole sentence was weird and off putting, but you get my drift). So far it has kept it cool.If there was a knock on it, the shape of the mouse is a bit odd. I do not have big hands, but it fits mine pretty well, but the hump in the middle almost seems lopsided. Hard to explain. It doesn't really affect the performance so its not a big deal.The accuracy is what I am really enjoying. It is not 100% but it is the best I have had in, I can't even remember, maybe ever. Clicking the little button above the scroll wheel got me a setting that was perfect. Flying around, hitting things, not having to go back and click again (meaning the mouse buttons are very responsive).Bottom line, I got this on a deal, and I probably would of paid 70-80 dollars for it if I knew it was going to be this good. Well worth the money. I am not going to say it is the Lamborghini of mice, but for the price it is a damn good one."}

The mouse was really light, which was a downside for me since I prefer a more substantial feel for accurate control in games (I should have known this though because of the listing). Despite its excellent sensor and configurable buttons, I had trouble getting used to the weight, which affected how well I played games. I chose to give it to a close friend who shares my love of gaming rather than leave it unused in the hopes that it would better suit their playing style.My friend couldn't have been happier with the gaming mouse, much to my happy surprise. They noticed right away how light it was, allowing for quick and accurate movements throughout their gaming sessions. They were impressed with how much their gameplay was enhanced by the mouse's sensitive sensor and programmable buttons. It was certainly a case of the right mouse finding the right owner, and I was thrilled to see my present make my friend's gaming setup so much more enjoyable and perform better. It's not uncommon for something that doesn't work for one person to be the ideal fit for another; in this case, it was a situation where everyone won, which improved both of our gaming experiences."}

As stated on the product page itself, it's light and honeycombed, and has the standard 2 buttons on the side.The side buttons were placed in such a way that it's easy to accidentally hit them with your thumb just by squeezing the mouse slightly, which can happen pretty often. Given that some commonly used apps have functions unchangeably tied to these buttons, pressing them on accident gets frustrating at times.By default, the mouse wheel glows, constantly changing color. If you have it in a space that needs to have little to no light, this might be an issue. There's probably a way to change it through some dedicated HyperX software but I wasn't bothered by the light. What I was bothered by, however, is that the wheel may scroll in the opposite direction (I scroll down, the page scrolls up, and vice versa). This is extremely problematic if you're doing something that needs you to be able to mouse scroll with precision, and I don't see a way to change this besides move the function to something else and set nothing on the wheel.All in all, I wouldn't call it better or worse than what I've previously used, and while I don't need to replace it, I still have enough reasons to do so if the opportunity presents itself."}

I’ve had a few Corsair, and even a few different versions of Finalmouse. But I decided to take a chance on this HyperX mouse now that my previous favorite “Finalmouse”, has gotten way too expensive for me to justify the purchase.It’s been I think 10 months or so since I bought the mouse, and it still functions exactly as the day I bought it. One thing I had a problem with other brands was the middle mouse button breaking on me after about 6 months of use, but this one feels solid and is still in working order.I’m also a huge fan of the lightweight honey comb feature, which also helps prevent your hand from sweating during extended gaming sessions. The program used to customize the lighting and set the DPI is very easy to use. I also like that it has different color codings for each DPI cycle. The size is also just right, I have medium-large hands, and it fits nice and comfortably in my hand.This is definitely a must-have mouse, and if it ever fails me, I will 100% buy another."}

The mouse buttons are way to easy to click. I find myself accidentally hitting the right button, even just skimming it while I am in the middle of working and it clicks it. Definitely needs to be a tougher click. Again, not a huge deal, but it is one I am experiencing now.ORIGINAL REVIEW:For the past two years I have been in search of a new mouse. I am willing to pay top dollar for it, since I will use it for years and it will help me with my video editing, graphic design, etc. BUT my issue is spending that money only to find out the mouse is crap and I have to return it, or I get lazy and don't and lose the money, etc etc.Right out of the gate I was loving it. The wire for this is more a silky cloth like coating. It does not catch on the edge of my desk and it is smooth enough that it does not give me any pull when I am using the mouse. (Where the rough rubber / plastic wires would catch on the edge and give me grief from time to time).The holes in the mouse are important. I work on videos and sometimes I am intensely editing and my hand gets moist, and sweaty and it makes the mouse feel weird. (That whole sentence was weird and off putting, but you get my drift). So far it has kept it cool.If there was a knock on it, the shape of the mouse is a bit odd. I do not have big hands, but it fits mine pretty well, but the hump in the middle almost seems lopsided. Hard to explain. It doesn't really affect the performance so its not a big deal.The accuracy is what I am really enjoying.

(less awesome software.)", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2022", "purchased": "Color: BlackPattern Name: Wired", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "For context, I'm coming from a Redragon Cobra M711 and I didn't want to spend the extra $10 on a Glorious Model O. And to be honest, I'm absolutely glad I went for this mouse.Pros:- This mouse is SUPER light. it's as light as a Finalmouse while being significantly cheaper. I definitely notice the difference from my M711 and it's a lot nicer. Glides pretty well.- The cable is super loose. it's about as loose as a shoestring, so I feel no resistance if the cable rubs up on something. basically feels like the mouse is wireless.- The scroll wheel is nice and stiff. Hard to describe, but it doesn't feel nearly as \"loose\" as the scroll wheel on my Cobra M711. If you use your scroll wheel when playing games, it makes an impact.- Doesn't feel super cheap. Not much more to say there, it just doesn't feel very cheap despite being only 40 dollars while also being super light.Cons:- Grip tape. Other reviews say it peels off after a while. I can tell mine isn't very secure, but I've had this mouse for a month and it hasn't fallen off. I haven't had an issue with it but since other have I'll put it here.- Software. Another thing everyone else is complaining about, and I can see why people are getting annoyed. Apparently the DPI settings reset every time you restart your PC but since I play on 800 DPI (one of the default DPI settings) I have had no issues. The RGB and button configs do save so no issues there either.- Side buttons are kinda stiff. I use my side buttons a lot when gaming, and I can tell they're not as easy to press down as the ones on my Cobra M711. They still register just fine for the most part though, so it's not huge.- Ergonomics. My 20 dollar Cobra M711 had better ergonomics. The left and right clicks on this mouse feel like they're positioned lower, and the shape doesn't melt into my hand as well as my Cobra M711. This mouse is ambidextrous though, so take that as you will.The pros definitely outweigh the cons for me, I don't know about everyone else. Any issues others have had with this thing have not been to significant to me. DEFINITELY recommend."}

I wasnt sure I would like it, and immediately thought \"I better return it\". However, I decided to give it a go. I slapped the rubber pads on it, loaded up my game and gave it a test drive. Took me less than 5 minutes to adapt to the weight of it, and it feels solid. It fixed my current issue with my more expensive Razer, and it just feels nice in my hand. My only complaint is that its ergonomic and I wish it had options for left or right handed. But otherwise it might be my new favorite mouse for under $45 which as far as gaming mice these days is a steal! Definitely give this a go if you're looking for something simple that just works, and does exactly what you need it to. I would buy another if it dies on me."}

Affordable Price: One of the standout features of the Redragon M602 is its budget-friendly price. It's an excellent choice for gamers on a tight budget or those looking for a secondary gaming mouse.2. RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this mouse is a nice touch, especially considering its price. You can customize the lighting effects through Redragon's software, adding a bit of flair to your setup.3. Comfortable Design: The ergonomic design of the mouse makes it comfortable to hold for extended gaming sessions. The textured side grips provide a secure and comfortable grip, and the mouse fits well in the hand.4. Customizable Buttons: With 7 programmable buttons, you have the flexibility to set up macros and shortcuts to enhance your gaming experience. This is a nice feature to have, especially at this price point.Cons:1. Build Quality: The build quality of the Redragon M602 leaves something to be desired. It feels a bit plasticky and less durable compared to higher-end gaming mice. Over time, this may affect its longevity.2. Sensor and Accuracy: The mouse uses an Avago sensor, which is decent but not as precise as some of the sensors found in more expensive gaming mice. This can lead to issues with accuracy, especially in fast-paced games.3. Software: While the mouse does come with customization software, it's not the most user-friendly. Setting up macros and adjusting DPI settings can be a bit cumbersome, and the software lacks some of the features offered by other gaming mouse software.4. Cable Quality: The cable is not as flexible as some other gaming mice, which can lead to drag and affect your movement during gaming.5. Weight: The Redragon M602 is on the heavier side, which might not be suitable for gamers who prefer lightweight mice for faster and more precise movements.Conclusion:The Redragon M602 RGB Wired Gaming Mouse is a budget-friendly option that offers some decent features for its price. It's comfortable to hold, has customizable RGB lighting, and programmable buttons. However, it falls short in terms of build quality, sensor precision, and software usability. If you're on a tight budget and need a gaming mouse for casual gaming, the Redragon M602 can get the job done. However, if you're a serious gamer looking for top-notch performance and build quality, you might want to consider investing a bit more in a higher-end gaming mouse."}

It would work best with a red theme in my opinion (simply because the cord is red) but I have mine tuned to a nice icy blue just to light up my PC dungeon when the lamp is off.By searching up their software, you can map basic macros to it (I set mine to automatically do a \"grapple\" move in The Force Unleashed II) and it has a total of 6 clickable buttons in addition to the wheel. If you don't care about that, you can disable the buttons, switch them around, or map them to common actions like copy, paste, stop/play, go back, open \"run\", etc.You can also adjust the rate at which the pointer moves across the screen using the DPI menu in the software. By default, the mouse has one of the middle buttons mapped to cycling through various preset DPI settings, and will have the other middle button mapped to cycling through RGB presets. Of course, both of these can be disabled or changed.There's a lot of subjectivity in this point, but I find it pretty comfortable. The top of the mouse might be a bit too wide for smaller hands.All in all, it's nothing special, but it's great bang for the buck and perfect for a budget gaming PC build."}

My Encounter with the Redragon M602 White", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2023", "purchased": "Color: WhiteStyle: Wired", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n My experience with the Redragon M602 White has been quite a journey. There are certainly areas where it excels, but it does have its pitfalls.To start, the software and driver support for the M602 White is a nightmare. The mouse doesn't have dedicated software, and despite my efforts to navigate Redragon's unorganized website for a compatible program, I came up empty-handed. Interestingly, this product isn't even listed on their Global site but is available on their American site. It's a rather perplexing situation. The mouse shows up as a \"HID-Compliant Mouse\" in Windows 11. When attempt to use software made by RedDragon to connect to the mouse for button remapping and RGB control you are told \"Gaming mouse disconnected\" when it's clearly not. There is no software or driver for this mouse. It's purely a plug and play device. It's not even recognized as anything more or less then a generic mouse on Windows 11.I strongly advise against trying to install software not specifically designed for this mouse model. I tried to do just this for writing this product review. My attempt at installing M602-RGB software resulted in a catastrophic lockout of my mouse clicking capabilities on my Windows 11 machine. I had to fix the issue by navigating using only the keyboard and TAB key to uninstall the software. It was a nerve-wracking ordeal. Without any RedDragon software installed, the M602 White, along with my other computer mice, work fine.The M602 is equipped with on-board controls for adjusting the RGB lighting and DPI settings, located beneath the scroll wheel. The color modes and DPI are controlled via a series of button presses. Understanding the interplay between DPI changes and color cues was tricky at first, but the product manual clarified this. Cycling through the color modes leads to my favorite - the rainbow setting.For its price point, the M602 is a decent investment if you're seeking a cheap, stylish, RGB-enabled mouse. I almost returned it but decided to keep it for its aesthetics. While I would have preferred a black model with a higher DPI range, the existing DPI level of the M602 works fine for my non-competitive gaming needs.The RGB elements are a major plus for me, especially the bright colors and smooth transitions of the rainbow setting. I even wrapped the long connecting cable in a gold plastic wrap to enhance its aesthetics. Despite being one of Redragon's cheaper models, the quality holds up. The durable plastic container that comes with the mouse has been also been repurposed for other uses thanks to some added magnets.I am pleased with the M602 White, and I would consider buying a higher-end model from Redragon again when I need a new computer mouse. RedDragon may not produce flawless products, but the quality is solid for the price. I would recommend the M602 White, but with the clear warning about its software issues."}

I also like the colors and the feel of the mouse on a mouse pad .Went to use it this morning and the top part of the mouse is dead although the red underneath ( used to be called a trackball when it had moving parts ) is still lit. Swapped it out for another mouse and the other mouse works fine .No surprises, though.  I am ordering another one. ( Oh I forgot to mention, I also bought one of these for work and replaced the one the company provided.)"}

That said its a bang for its buck!", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackStyle: Wired Mouse", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "1. Affordable Price: One of the standout features of the Redragon M602 is its budget-friendly price. It's an excellent choice for gamers on a tight budget or those looking for a secondary gaming mouse.2. RGB Lighting: The RGB lighting on this mouse is a nice touch, especially considering its price. You can customize the lighting effects through Redragon's software, adding a bit of flair to your setup.3. Comfortable Design: The ergonomic design of the mouse makes it comfortable to hold for extended gaming sessions. The textured side grips provide a secure and comfortable grip, and the mouse fits well in the hand.4. Customizable Buttons: With 7 programmable buttons, you have the flexibility to set up macros and shortcuts to enhance your gaming experience. This is a nice feature to have, especially at this price point.Cons:1. Build Quality: The build quality of the Redragon M602 leaves something to be desired. It feels a bit plasticky and less durable compared to higher-end gaming mice. Over time, this may affect its longevity.2. Sensor and Accuracy: The mouse uses an Avago sensor, which is decent but not as precise as some of the sensors found in more expensive gaming mice. This can lead to issues with accuracy, especially in fast-paced games.3. Software: While the mouse does come with customization software, it's not the most user-friendly. Setting up macros and adjusting DPI settings can be a bit cumbersome, and the software lacks some of the features offered by other gaming mouse software.4. Cable Quality: The cable is not as flexible as some other gaming mice, which can lead to drag and affect your movement during gaming.5. Weight: The Redragon M602 is on the heavier side, which might not be suitable for gamers who prefer lightweight mice for faster and more precise movements.Conclusion:The Redragon M602 RGB Wired Gaming Mouse is a budget-friendly option that offers some decent features for its price. It's comfortable to hold, has customizable RGB lighting, and programmable buttons. However, it falls short in terms of build quality, sensor precision, and software usability. If you're on a tight budget and need a gaming mouse for casual gaming, the Redragon M602 can get the job done. However, if you're a serious gamer looking for top-notch performance and build quality, you might want to consider investing a bit more in a higher-end gaming mouse."}

It would work best with a red theme in my opinion (simply because the cord is red) but I have mine tuned to a nice icy blue just to light up my PC dungeon when the lamp is off.By searching up their software, you can map basic macros to it (I set mine to automatically do a \"grapple\" move in The Force Unleashed II) and it has a total of 6 clickable buttons in addition to the wheel. If you don't care about that, you can disable the buttons, switch them around, or map them to common actions like copy, paste, stop/play, go back, open \"run\", etc.You can also adjust the rate at which the pointer moves across the screen using the DPI menu in the software. By default, the mouse has one of the middle buttons mapped to cycling through various preset DPI settings, and will have the other middle button mapped to cycling through RGB presets. Of course, both of these can be disabled or changed.There's a lot of subjectivity in this point, but I find it pretty comfortable. The top of the mouse might be a bit too wide for smaller hands.All in all, it's nothing special, but it's great bang for the buck and perfect for a budget gaming PC build."}

My Encounter with the Redragon M602 White", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2023", "purchased": "Color: WhiteStyle: Wired", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n My experience with the Redragon M602 White has been quite a journey. There are certainly areas where it excels, but it does have its pitfalls.To start, the software and driver support for the M602 White is a nightmare. The mouse doesn't have dedicated software, and despite my efforts to navigate Redragon's unorganized website for a compatible program, I came up empty-handed. Interestingly, this product isn't even listed on their Global site but is available on their American site. It's a rather perplexing situation. The mouse shows up as a \"HID-Compliant Mouse\" in Windows 11. When attempt to use software made by RedDragon to connect to the mouse for button remapping and RGB control you are told \"Gaming mouse disconnected\" when it's clearly not. There is no software or driver for this mouse. It's purely a plug and play device. It's not even recognized as anything more or less then a generic mouse on Windows 11.I strongly advise against trying to install software not specifically designed for this mouse model. I tried to do just this for writing this product review. My attempt at installing M602-RGB software resulted in a catastrophic lockout of my mouse clicking capabilities on my Windows 11 machine. I had to fix the issue by navigating using only the keyboard and TAB key to uninstall the software. It was a nerve-wracking ordeal. Without any RedDragon software installed, the M602 White, along with my other computer mice, work fine.The M602 is equipped with on-board controls for adjusting the RGB lighting and DPI settings, located beneath the scroll wheel. The color modes and DPI are controlled via a series of button presses. Understanding the interplay between DPI changes and color cues was tricky at first, but the product manual clarified this. Cycling through the color modes leads to my favorite - the rainbow setting.For its price point, the M602 is a decent investment if you're seeking a cheap, stylish, RGB-enabled mouse. I almost returned it but decided to keep it for its aesthetics. While I would have preferred a black model with a higher DPI range, the existing DPI level of the M602 works fine for my non-competitive gaming needs.The RGB elements are a major plus for me, especially the bright colors and smooth transitions of the rainbow setting. I even wrapped the long connecting cable in a gold plastic wrap to enhance its aesthetics. Despite being one of Redragon's cheaper models, the quality holds up. The durable plastic container that comes with the mouse has been also been repurposed for other uses thanks to some added magnets.I am pleased with the M602 White, and I would consider buying a higher-end model from Redragon again when I need a new computer mouse. RedDragon may not produce flawless products, but the quality is solid for the price. I would recommend the M602 White, but with the clear warning about its software issues."}

I have owned this mouse for about 3 years and it is just as good as brand new. When looking at the price of this mouse compared to other gaming mice, this is cheaper, durable, longer-lasting, and has most of the features as the other expensive mice have. I would most certainly recommend any interested buyers looking for a gaming mouse to buy this product. First and foremost, I think that the Redragon gaming mouse is one of the best mice as of right now because it’s cheap and affordable. When looking for a desktop gaming mouse, you should always research and look for other products that might be similar, less expensive, and easier to use especially when it comes to gaming mice. One of the popular gaming mice that is competing against the redragon mice in the market as of right now would be the glorious model o. This mouse comes around $100 in the market and functions similarly to the redragon mouse. The redragon mouse comes in around $20 as of now due to inflation as well. There isn’t much of a difference between the two mice besides the shape, size, and price. Paying $80 more isn’t worth it if most of the controls, and key features function the same way. Some of the key features that the glorious model o can do as well as the redragon gaming mouse are drag click, butterfly click, has the same amount of sensitivity, and DPI. The main difference between these two desktop gaming mice is that the glorious model “o” feels much lighter and sturdier. The redragon mouse feels a little bit heavier however, it is a decent size for any beginners or experienced gamers. It also has side palm grips for you to keep your thumb, ring finger, and pinky finger on support giving you the most comfortable experience as well. Some of the features that both mice can do that interested buyers would look forward to is having the mouse double click, drag click, and butterfly click. Furthermore, this mouse is very comfortable and durable for a long period of time. The gaming mouse's texture is matte which makes the gaming experience even better. There are also side buttons to change the RGB color or lighting to whichever settings you’d prefer with 7-8 different color options. All of these features are adjustable just by downloading the app or software if needed. After owning this product for 3 years, I have not felt the need to buy another mouse yet at all because of how well-made it is. However, despite all of the pros mentioned, there are always a few flaws or cons since nothing is perfect. One of the cons I experienced by owning this product would be that when gaming, some of the clicks on the redragon gaming mouse don’t register due to how big it is. Even though it is recommended to have lighter-weight desktop mice when gaming, it makes it harder to click while having some clicks not register. Over the past 3 years of owning this product, I have noticed that there is also a solution to fixing this problem. I have improved my gaming skills and it has made clicking faster and much easier for me. I would most definitely recommend this product to gamers who are at least experienced a little bit and have fast clicking hands to enjoy the full experience."}

It is still going strong. The optical switches are still the most reliable and responsive switches I have ever used. Even after millions of clicks and hardcore daily usage, this thing is as reliable as the day I got it. I can count on it to make clicks exactly when I intended to, never double clicking and never false triggering. Gamers know just how important this is.Battery still easily lasts for 2 days with constant usage and RGB brightness at the default 30%. Aside from the textures on the sidegrips having been worn completely smooth where the tip of my thumb rests and some discoloration of the skates, you practically cannot tell that this mouse has ever been used.I did run into a bit of trouble with the middle click requiring harder presses to register at one point. However, all I had to do was bang the mouse a couple times on the side against my mousepad and blow on the scroll wheel with pressurized air, and it has been working normally again ever since. Truly, nothing can faze this mouse.Of course, I should address that during those 2 years, Razer has updated the Viper series. To put it bluntly, the Viper V2 Pro is not worth it at all unless you value a 16g lighter weight over absolutely everything, on a mouse that is already extremely light. The V2 Pro lacks tons of features including side buttons on both sides, docked charging, and RGB. It also has a smaller battery. With this original Razer Viper Ultimate practically being permanently on sale now (being a \"previous generation\" mouse), it just has too much value over the new Viper V2 Pro, making the decision a no-brainer.In 2023, this is still the greatest mouse I have ever used, hands down. I still find it extremely comfortable in my hands. And there is no greater feeling than to know that I can always rely on this mouse to do exactly what I want it to do, 100% of the time.Razer, you'll have to do WAY better than the Viper V2 Pro to beat this Viper Ultimate.(P.S., Synapse is still terrible. It has no problems switching profiles anymore, but now it will occasionally go crazy with the CPU usage.)_____________________________________________Original Review:To preface - I find it very difficult to find a mouse shape that is comfortable for me.  My hands are roughly 19x10 cm and I use a full palm grip. My favorite mouse in terms of comfort is the Corsair Nightsword, followed by the Corsair M65. I also owned the Razer Basilisk, which is comfortable at first, but starts to cramp my hand with extended use.I have long been searching for a proper wireless mouse with a good RELIABLE connection, rechargeability/good battery life, a reasonable price, and of course above all, a good shape. It's no secret that the Viper Ultimate and the G Pro Wireless have been hailed as the best wireless mice around, but the price always kept me away from giving them a shot. Plus, I had heard about double click issues with the G Pro and the shape looked too ambidextrous for me. The more contoured shape of the Viper Ultimate and its optical switches caught my eye more. So when Prime Day came around and I saw the mouse + dock combo at $89.99, I jumped at the opportunity. (I would definitely not recommend paying $150 or even $120 for any mouse, it just isn't worth it.)Shape: 9/10I was scared of this the most since very few mice are comfortable to me. But when I started using the mouse, it felt great, to my surprise. Sure, the hump is a lower than I would have preferred, but my hand can rest very naturally on it with no cramping or fatigue. The low profile and relative lack of contours on the side make it slightly hard to pick up without it feeling like it's slipping out of your hand, but the incredibly light weight certainly makes up for it a bit. I didn't give it a 10/10 because for me, it still isn't as comfortable as the Corsair Nightsword (which feels like it was practically molded for my hand). Overall though, very comfortable and I plan to use it as my main mouse.Buttons: 9/10The main buttons are a 10/10 for me (Left click, Right click, and Scroll Wheel/Middle Click). They feel crisp and snappy with just enough feedback. I can definitely notice the optical switches. Every click feels EXTREMELY fast and responsive, but not in an oversensitive type of way. I use a mechanical keyboard with optical switches, and that has held up very well with 0 misfires or double-presses, so I am hoping for the same from this mouse. Every one of my mice with standard mechanical switches has ended up double clicking after some time and having to get replaced. My only problem with this mouse's buttons are the side buttons. They are way too recessed in the mouse (almost flush with the body) and I would definitely prefer them to stick out a bit more. Aside from that the buttons are very well built, with 0 wobble and a nice click.Software: 3/10Sorry Razer, but synapse just sucks. (Take some notes from Corsair please).The profile switching for recognizing different programs is extremely slow, causes the mouse to freeze up for a few seconds, and can even \"crash\" the mouse and require it to be turned on and off again. Apparently some other uses said this is because Synapse literally uploads the new profile to the mouse every time you switch programs, which is a terrible design. There IS a workaround, made possible by the fact that this mouse has on-board storage. Store the profiles you are using on the mouse's on-board storage, and you can use it without a hitch. However, this is really no excuse for Synapse to suck as there are plenty of other Razer mice that do not have on-board storage.The other big problem with Synapse is that macros do not immediately stop after you release a button - they will continue playing to completion. This severely limits the number of applications where you would choose to use a macro as this makes it too unsafe to use in many situations.Wireless: 10/10 (With the workaround stated above)Great connectivity - extremely reliable and responsive, as long as you use the workaround for Synapse. Switching profiles without the workaround was the only time the mouse would ever hiccup/disconnect. With the work around, it is just as reliable as a wired connection. And when the mouse goes into \"sleep\" mode, I hardly notice a delay when I wake it up.Sensor: 10/10Great sensor, combined with the low weight and low-friction gliding feet the tracking is silky smooth. Lift off distance is extremely low as well and can be further adjusted in Synapse.Weight: 10/10Extremely light. Do I sometimes miss having a sniper button to lower my DPI? Sure. But do I need it with such a light mouse? Certainly not. Any small micro-movements are extremely easy to make and it requires little to no-effort to move this mouse.Battery Life: 10/10I've been using this mouse with the default setting of 33% RGB brightness, and when I'm actively using the mouse at the computer for the whole day (12+ hours), it barely goes down to 70%. For less intensive use, you might last a whole 5 days without charging, or even a whole week. If you turn off the RGB, you could go for even longer._____________________________________________Final remarks:While the shape doesn't quite reach the 10/10 comfort that the Corsair Nightsword is for me, it is still extremely comfortable at a 9/10. Had I not experienced the Nightsword, I might have rated this a 10/10. It is comfortable enough that, combined with being wireless and having optical switches, I am completely sold on it. It is now my new primary mouse.The buttons are great, and I have high hopes for the reliability of the optical switches as Razer is the mouse maker currently using them. Wireless connectivity and and battery life are amazing. Synapse is the only thing that sucks. Razer please fix the software - it's borderline a dealbreaker that makes me reluctant to ever consider Razer products. If you ever see this mouse on sale, I highly recommend it. Just don't ever pay more than $100 for a mouse unless it was signed by Bob Ross."}

This is hands down the best Razer mouse I've used so far and possibly the best mouse I've used as well.  I haven't been on the bandwagon for lighter and lighter weight mice.  Now I might have to jump on that train because the Viper Ultimate is so shockingly light I have a hard time believing that it still works.  Previously I had the Razer Taipan and perceptually it's about 2.5 times heavier.  The transition over has taken a bit of time to get used to but I do like it.  It does feel like you can rapidly change the direction the mouse is moving without much effort and it could lead to better performance playing shooters in particular.Both the Taipan and the Viper Ultimate have rubber grips on the sides of the mouse, and I think It's a really nice feature of both.  I've used wireless mice in the past, a Microsoft one that failed me several times in the heat of battle that used AAA batteries.  I was really unsure about using a wireless mouse again but I figured it was about time to try one again, possibly the technology has improved over the years and certainly it has.  I was tempted by the Razer Orochi v2 but I didn't want to be buying batteries over and over.  I think the Viper Ultimate is a bit better for my personal preferences and I really do like it.  I was watching some YouTube videos analyzing the latency differences between current wireless mice and wired mice.  For the first time I think wireless mice are so competitive with wired mice its there is no major reason to be using a wired mouse outside of cost.  The Razer Viper Ultimate is a great example of this.  There may be a valid argument that the Viper 8k has superior performance over the Viper Ultimate Wireless but the mice refresh rate is so far above what most monitors can display at 1000Hz pooling rate It doesn't feel like there is a major reason to be concerned about it.  Not only that but I've heard the processing required to keep track of the cursor at 8000Hz actually drops your in game frame rate by about 3-4 frames per second (depending on your hardware configuration of course).  I don't see the benefit of a 8000Hz pooling rate right now.  In the end I think it's a great time to transition to a wireless mouse if your interested in it and are able to afford it.I purchased the version of the Viper Ultimate which included the dock and I'm glad I did.  The dock has a magnet on it which makes far easier to rest the mouse on the dock in the correct position for it to charge and you really just don't have to think about dropping the mouse on the dock, the convenience is great.  My only complaint about the dock is that it's so light that sometimes I pull up on the mouse and the dock actually lifts off my desk because the magnet is strong enough to carry the weight of the dock for a few seconds before it drops.  I guess the engineers of the mouse decided to add a sticky pad on the bottom of the dock to help with this but I think this is a lame solution.  A weighted dock design would be far superior in my opinion and hopefully it will be included in a future release.  I don't like the thought of a sticky pad on my desk, it might make a gross sticky mess (which thankfully it hasn't) and possibly will become a hard dusty mass in a few years time anyway.  That's really my biggest complaint with the mouse/dock combo.A minor issue I have with the mouse itself is the Teflon feet.  I wish there was a larger Teflon pad at the back end of the mouse, or maybe two separate feet that are larger that covers that back end area a bit better.  In the past I've used mice for years and years on end before replacing them and the back end of the mouse get's the most feet pad wear (at least for me).  I feel like the Viper Ultimate may not last as long just because the back end feet are not significant enough and they are positioned far to the sides of the mouse, to the point I'll be lifting the mouse up off the mousepad surface and then setting it down, back down back end first and dragging the plastic of the mouse on the plastic mousepad surface for a few moments before the Teflon feet make contact with the mousepad.  This is not ideal in my opinion.Razer synapse, I personally don't mind running software in the background for peripherals as long as it doesn't take up too many system resources and Synapse doesn't.  I HATE the way one has to log into an account to make use of some of the features.  No mouse should require one to create an account to make full use of a mouse, that is a garbage idea for user convenience.  I personally think convenience should be prioritized over most aspects of a products design and this causes me anger every time the synapse software asks me for the password that I usually have forgotten in the weeks that go by where I don't have to enter the password.  Even if I tell it to remember my password the Synapse software still asks me for my password from time to time (I think when it does an update).  It's difficult for me to put into words how rage inducing this is, mostly because it feels so unnecessary.  The software should remember your password no matter what, #1 and #2 you should not need to create an account to make use of mouse software, It's trash on two fronts.  Okay, Razer is a business and they feel like they require minor tracking of their customer base so they can make better business decisions and satisfy customers.  I don't like it at all but hypothetically I can understand.  Message to Razer: Make the Synapse software remember your log in info no matter what.  This software design is just as important as your hardware design work.  For over half of the use of my Razer Taipan I didn't use Synapse at all because it was such a pain in the rear end to make sure I'm logged in all the time.  This may indeed only be an issue with the older version of Synapse, so far I haven't had this issue since purchasing the Viper Ultimate.  I really hope Razer has resolved this and I no longer will be plagued with login requests.In the end very few products are perfect and it is hard to fault the Viper Ultimate Wireless with very much.  I think it's a product worth buying and I'm glad I purchased it, I hope it will last me a few years and be a valuable part of my gaming hardware arsenal.  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing this mouse, I wouldn't hesitate too much, its pretty awesome overall.  It is a bit more pricy compared to some wired options but I do prefer wireless over a corded mouse even with a cord bungie (which are really great by the way).  Definitely consider the Viper Ultimate Wireless mouse if your in the market for a mouse, It's a great option in my opinion, despite my complaints."}

From keypads, to keyboards, and now mice as well. The Viper Ultimate is Razer’s one-two punch answer to the Logitech G Pro wireless, which is now getting on over a year old, and it is quite the response. Featuring an incredibly comfortable and sleek ambidextrous design, the Viper Ultimate stands tall amongst its peers, offering one of the best gaming experiences you can have with a mouse.Razer designed the original wired Viper with a key feature set in mind – creating a light, fast, wickedly responsive and premium gaming mouse and the Viper Ultimate adds to that with the addition of wireless connectivity. Long gone are the days of wireless mice being shunned by gamers and only being reserved for travel or general purpose use, wireless mice now stand at the forefront of gaming with offerings from Razer, Corsair, Logitech, Steelseries and other major manufacturers as upgrades to their wired siblings.The Viper and Viper Ultimate offer an extremely comfortable shape and design that really shows how far Razer has come with their mouse design. Subtle comfort grooves in the buttons, crisp button presses, well-stepped mouse wheel, and extremely comfortable rubber sides really make the mouse feel premium. The Viper is ideal for medium to medium-large hands, offering comfortable grip options for both palm, claw, and hybrid grip styles. Fingertip grip is possible here, but not recommended as the mouse as a longer body that is not well suited to fingertip grip styles. Integrated firm rubber sides, textured matte plastic body, and super comfortable shape for left and right handed users really take the spotlight. The mouse has side buttons on both sides, but are cleverly designed so that you never have to worry about accidental presses on either side, and even if you are worried about still somehow hitting the side buttons on the opposite side of the mouse – it is a simple enough task to go into the software and disable them. The mouse is also extremely rigid and sturdy, having no flex or bowing at all, there is a slight rattle but I think it is either in the mouse wheel or lens of the sensor. Not sure though, but it is nothing to be worried about, pretty standard fare there, though I would like to see that eliminated in the future., Lighting is minimal, with the only RGB goodness being the classic Razer logo on the butt of the mouse being lit up, but the charging stand also has an RGB LED on its base and integrates seamlessly into the Razer Chroma ecosystem and works as expected.Ultra low latency, long battery life, and ditching the cable drag are great bullet points for any wireless mouse manufacturer to have – but only a few have managed to add “under 100g” to that list. Logitech launched their G Pro wireless last year with a surprising 78g weight that was lighter than most wired mice, and now that smaller, lighter mice are in – it was the perfect time for Razer to fire back. The Viper Ultimate weighs in at a shockingly light and nimble 74g (2.6 ounces), beating out everything but the Glorious Model O series, the Finalmouse UItralight 2, and the Coolermaster MM710. And at 74g, I would gladly give up my Finalmouse’s ultra-feathery light weight for a better shape and wireless capabilities. I’d also be shocked if we didn’t see an even lighter Viper out next year with the ever popular honey comb design and even lighter materials, I’m almost positive that they could get the weight below 50g with relative ease.So we have a masterful recipe for success here with a great weight and balance, wireless connectivity, and sleek design and shape, but what about the internals?I am glad to say that the inside of the Viper and Viper Ultimate are just as well designed as the outside. The sensor is the result of the partnership between PixArt and Razer, and what they’ve brought with the 3399 is an incredibly fast, accurate, top-of-the line optical sensor that is near flawless in its execution. While the reported resolution of the sensor goes up to a true 20,000 cpi – we all know that none of us will ever even come close to using that level of granularity given that the overwhelming majority of gamers use 2000 dpi or lower. But it is nice to know that the option is there – in the event that we have 20K displays. The bottom is equipped with pure 100% PTFE feet without any dye positioned at the corners of the mouse and around the sensor itself. The absence of the black dye means there is zero grittiness to the glide of the mouse when moving it, and rivals that of aftermarket mouse feet like Hyperglides. The only reason you’ll ever need to replace these feet is if they ever wear out, they’re as good as mouse feet get. The clicks are satisfying and tactile, offering an instant response due to their opto-electric nature. Speaking of which, the opto-electric switches are great! Because there are no actual contacts, the switches have an incredibly long lifespan, over 50 million clicks and are immune to double-clicking that their mechanical microswitch brethren are notorious for.Included with the mouse is a charging dock that functions both as a home for the wireless receiver if you so choose and as a convenient and fast way to charge the mouse when not in use. Simply plop the mouse on the dock when you walk away to get a drink or go to bed, it is as simple as that – not that you’ll need to do that very often. The Viper Ultimate sports a staggeringly impressive maximum battery life of 70+ hours on one charge, and can be charged from 0-80% in 90 minutes or less. The cable used to plug into the charging dock can be used to connect the mouse directly to the computer to be used in a wired state, if you for some reason should want to do that. It is very lightweight and flexible, only ever so slightly stiffer than the Viper wired cable. Let’s be real here though, if you’re buying a wireless mouse only to plug it in and use it wired, what are you doing?At $150, it might be a tough purchase for some – but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it. If you are looking for the absolute best wireless gaming mouse out there right now, the Viper Ultimate is it. There is little room for debate on whether or not the Viper Ultimate is the king of gaming mice in 2019. Ultimately though, the best mouse for you is the one that feels best in your hand. So many mice have top optical sensors and similar specs, that it comes down to personal preference in regards to the shape. For me, the Viper Ultimate shape fits my hands extraordinarily well, whereas the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 and Logitech G Pro wireless exist at opposite ends of comfort for me. The Ultralight 2 is too small for my hands, and the G Pro feels too much like a semi-circular plastic dome, but the Viper Ultimate is just right.If there’s anything I would consider changing it would be creating a honey-comb shell design that would further reduce the weight and possibly making the side buttons modular, similar to that of Logitech’s offerings so that if we so choose to could simply remove the side buttons for the side of the mouse that we are not using.Razer, 2019 is the year you came back hard. I love what you’re offering and I really hope 2020 brings as much if not more innovation to your future product lines. You guys are champions, once more."}

The switches are pretty much the entire reason I bought this mouse over other mice. I'M SO SICK OF THE DOUBLE CLICK ISSUE AND I'M PRAYING THIS FIXES IT. Happened to my original Naga, kept me from buying another Razer mouse but then it happened even worse to my Zowie EC2-A. They are about the same \"speed\" as normal switches. Latency isn't better or worse. You can test this online.+ This is my first wireless mouse and I'm pleased to say that wireless feels just as responsive  as wired mode. VERY nice to not have to deal with a wire anymore and not have any downsides.+ Good customization within Synapse such as button programming, lighting, power-saving mode threshold, custom DPI, lift-off distance, etc.+ Saving to onboard memory is great, as is having the option to log in to synapse as Guest.+ Different methods of using and charging the mouse is really nice.+ Feet are good. No issues and glide nicely on a QCK Heavy. Texture on the shell is good and grippy. I prefer this textured plastic over a rubber coating. Rubber sides feel good. Grippy and not mushy at all. Mouse wheel has good feedback and feels good to scroll (for now) and has a nice grippy texture. Side buttons and scroll wheel feel pretty good to click and the NORMAL ones aren't in the way (left side for right-handed, right side for left-handed). There's no play/travel distance on the side buttons like there is on some mice like my old EC2-A.+ Battery life seems good. Going to actually test it now on full charge with lighting off but so far it seems as-advertised, at least for the most part.- After leaving it charging all night through the direct connection and from maybe around 20%, Synapse only read a 97% charge. I restarted Synapse to see if it was reading wrong but it still read 97%. I placed it on the dock for a few minutes and it fully charged to 100%. Not sure what that's about but thought I'd mention it. Will test this more.- Unsure if it's just Windows 7 not playing nice with it, but when switching modes, the mouse sometimes doesn't allow me to interact with things outside of my online browser. For example,  I'll switch from wired to wireless mode and I'll be able to move my cursor and interact with my  browser but NOTHING else is interactable until I restart the Windows explorer process. I can't highlight icons, close or open programs, windows or anything. Very strange and really hope this won't be an ongoing issue.- Could be an issue on my end but Synapse doesn't recognize the mouse or dock on either of my USB 3.0 ports. ONLY when I use the wireless receiver by itself does it recognize the mouse in Synapse. If the receiver is in the dock or even if the wire is connected directly to the mouse, Synapse will not pick it up. I still have function but can't change any settings until I use a USB 2 port. Ports work fine with other hardware.- Just a few days in and, though still good, the mouse wheel has slightly lost some of it's  snappiness in it's scroll and the left and right clicks have developed a slight give. Somewhat  nitpicking here, but I would really hate it if the mouse felt like crap to use in just a few months.  For the price, this things should be rock solid for years and not develop that mushy cheapness.- Didn't think I would, but I constantly press the sidebuttons on the right side when I'm aiming (I use it in my right hand). I had to disable them through Synapse. Thankfully you can and then save the setting to internal  memory. Unfortunately, I can't use them now for other things if I wanted to, such as  volume control.- Some part of the Razer software (Razer Synapse Service Process) stays running even after you select \"Exit All Apps\" from the  tray icon. This happened with my old Razer Naga too. Normally, I wouldn't care THAT much, but this particular process KILLS fps in my games. I literally have to end the process or games stutter like crazy for some reason, or at least Overwatch does.- Really just personal opinion, but it'd be nice if Razer would make some smaller mice. Pretty much all of their mice are too big in one way or another for someone with smaller hands and depending on how you grip. This one is just a bit too long for me personally.Overall, I think if it lasts and the shell doesn't become mushy and creaky like it very well may with enough use, it's everything a competitive FPS player would ever need IF (big if) the mouse fits your hand well. Measure your hands and decide for yourself. Mine are roughly...H 7.25 inches x W 4.25 inches (H 18.415 cm x W 10.795 cm)3 finger width (index, middle, ring) =  2.125 inches (5.3975 cm)Middle finger + knuckle = 4 1/4 inches (10.795 cm)And I probably fall somewhere between claw and fingertip grip, probably leaning more towards fingertip.--------------------------------------------So far, for me, after less than one week with the mouse:Performance: 10/10Comfort: 6.5/10 (subjective and also still getting used to the shape so likely to go up, but hitting sidebuttons accidentally sucks - also my first ambidextrous)Feedback: 8.5/10 (this will get lower if the shell quality doesn't hold and the snappiness diminishes)Quality: 8/10 (mostly concerned about long-term quality here as left/right buttons already have some slight give/shake to them after a few days of use and the scroll doesn't feel like it's going to hold it's feeling of precision and snappiness in it's steps - otherwise though, pretty solid)Software: 7/10 (good options but a little too bloated - can thankfully choose which software you'd like to install)Value: 7/10 (I got it on sale for $120 but I think it's worth more around $100 - if it was perfect for my hand and grip, $120 would be kind of okay maybe, however twice the price of the wired is high enough - full price is simply too much and in the end, I might come to regret not just buying two $60 mice and a bungee)Currently, this mouse is hovering around an 8 or 8.5/10 for me. This is likely to go up to a 9 with use and as I get used to it's size and shape, just as long as quality and performance stays the same as it is now. Overall I commend Razer for innovating and listening to it's customers and I hope to enjoy this mouse with no issue for years to come."}

That should say how much I use my mouse, not counting how rough I am on my mice, such as when sliding & lifting them across my mouse-pad or the occasional accidental drop.

(Abbreviating Deathadder to DA from now on)That's not to say I haven't had issues with Razer products, my first DA V2 lasted 1 week until both the left click and the scroll wheel started failing leading me to then use the other brand name mice; G502 Hero lasted 5 months, Corsair M55 lasted 2 weeks,and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste lasted 3 months.My next Razer product was a DA V2 pro and that one lasted 2 years, Which led me to buy this one after that one started not sensing right clicks.Issues:I had zero issues with it for 8 months, then, entirely out of random, started having weird issues with connectivity.  This started out with very minuscule connectivity issues, such as it waiting 30 seconds for my PC and Razer's software to start working properly to use the mouse when it gets turned on after being off for a while.This was annoying, but I didn't care too much about that since I could still do whatever I needed to do.But fast forward ~4 months and the issues have compounded a little bit and I get my connection cut off when playing games for a solid 4 seconds at a time, and at this point this is getting REALLY annoying to endure (This happens plugged in too).At this point I am also having issues with the mouse having a slowed reception & it being able to hold a charge for more than half a day. I used to be able to use it at it's highest pulling rate and low brightness of the LED for 5 days without charging.Positives:Very durable plastic, I have very little wear on the mouse besides a bit of wear on the left click plastic making it shiny instead of matte black.Very comfortable if you claw grip your mouse (Not comfortable if you palm the entire mouse).Very light and easy to move on a mouse-pad.Fairly priced, ~$60 is quite decent for this mouse.Lasted 10 Months until having some bigger issues (Most mice completely break around the 5th month for me).Scroll wheel is perfect, zero squeaking (like a Corsair M55) or aggressive rumble feeling (like a Logitech G502) and has a good rubberized texture to it (HyperX Pulsefire haste didn't have any great texturing).Great for putting into a schoolbag for college or for storing in a laptop case.Buttons and sensor are great and feel immaculate.Cons:Either the USB dongle, or the mouse itself is having issues cutting out and not working at random after close to a year of use. The same with sensitivity, it has definitely gone down for the sensor.Battery is now starting to have issues holding a charge.This is where I am currently at with this mouse, It has worked very well for what it is, but I may soon have to upgrade, due to the issues I am having.You will probably have a longer service life on your mouse though, especially if you are not rough on your electronics.I would 100% recommend this if you need it for a laptop and need it to be wireless, or have smaller hands that are not as fitting for a Razer Deathadder."}

If you play a song that some guy hit the bass drum once, the cursor is moving on you. I've been playing FPS games all of my life, but I can't get the flick down for this mouse; the lack of weight gives 0 feedback to your hand. You are basically reactionary to everything. By that, I mean move the mouse first, react to how the screen moves, then adjust accordingly. Hard to get muscle memory to something that delivers no feedback cause this things weighs as much as a penny.Battery Life, Charging and the Razer app were all good, no issues to report on that."}

It is still going strong. The optical switches are still the most reliable and responsive switches I have ever used. Even after millions of clicks and hardcore daily usage, this thing is as reliable as the day I got it. I can count on it to make clicks exactly when I intended to, never double clicking and never false triggering. Gamers know just how important this is.Battery still easily lasts for 2 days with constant usage and RGB brightness at the default 30%. Aside from the textures on the sidegrips having been worn completely smooth where the tip of my thumb rests and some discoloration of the skates, you practically cannot tell that this mouse has ever been used.I did run into a bit of trouble with the middle click requiring harder presses to register at one point. However, all I had to do was bang the mouse a couple times on the side against my mousepad and blow on the scroll wheel with pressurized air, and it has been working normally again ever since. Truly, nothing can faze this mouse.Of course, I should address that during those 2 years, Razer has updated the Viper series. To put it bluntly, the Viper V2 Pro is not worth it at all unless you value a 16g lighter weight over absolutely everything, on a mouse that is already extremely light. The V2 Pro lacks tons of features including side buttons on both sides, docked charging, and RGB. It also has a smaller battery. With this original Razer Viper Ultimate practically being permanently on sale now (being a \"previous generation\" mouse), it just has too much value over the new Viper V2 Pro, making the decision a no-brainer.In 2023, this is still the greatest mouse I have ever used, hands down. I still find it extremely comfortable in my hands. And there is no greater feeling than to know that I can always rely on this mouse to do exactly what I want it to do, 100% of the time.Razer, you'll have to do WAY better than the Viper V2 Pro to beat this Viper Ultimate.(P.S., Synapse is still terrible. It has no problems switching profiles anymore, but now it will occasionally go crazy with the CPU usage.)_____________________________________________Original Review:To preface - I find it very difficult to find a mouse shape that is comfortable for me.  My hands are roughly 19x10 cm and I use a full palm grip. My favorite mouse in terms of comfort is the Corsair Nightsword, followed by the Corsair M65. I also owned the Razer Basilisk, which is comfortable at first, but starts to cramp my hand with extended use.I have long been searching for a proper wireless mouse with a good RELIABLE connection, rechargeability/good battery life, a reasonable price, and of course above all, a good shape. It's no secret that the Viper Ultimate and the G Pro Wireless have been hailed as the best wireless mice around, but the price always kept me away from giving them a shot. Plus, I had heard about double click issues with the G Pro and the shape looked too ambidextrous for me. The more contoured shape of the Viper Ultimate and its optical switches caught my eye more. So when Prime Day came around and I saw the mouse + dock combo at $89.99, I jumped at the opportunity. (I would definitely not recommend paying $150 or even $120 for any mouse, it just isn't worth it.)Shape: 9/10I was scared of this the most since very few mice are comfortable to me. But when I started using the mouse, it felt great, to my surprise. Sure, the hump is a lower than I would have preferred, but my hand can rest very naturally on it with no cramping or fatigue. The low profile and relative lack of contours on the side make it slightly hard to pick up without it feeling like it's slipping out of your hand, but the incredibly light weight certainly makes up for it a bit. I didn't give it a 10/10 because for me, it still isn't as comfortable as the Corsair Nightsword (which feels like it was practically molded for my hand). Overall though, very comfortable and I plan to use it as my main mouse.Buttons: 9/10The main buttons are a 10/10 for me (Left click, Right click, and Scroll Wheel/Middle Click). They feel crisp and snappy with just enough feedback. I can definitely notice the optical switches. Every click feels EXTREMELY fast and responsive, but not in an oversensitive type of way. I use a mechanical keyboard with optical switches, and that has held up very well with 0 misfires or double-presses, so I am hoping for the same from this mouse. Every one of my mice with standard mechanical switches has ended up double clicking after some time and having to get replaced. My only problem with this mouse's buttons are the side buttons. They are way too recessed in the mouse (almost flush with the body) and I would definitely prefer them to stick out a bit more. Aside from that the buttons are very well built, with 0 wobble and a nice click.Software: 3/10Sorry Razer, but synapse just sucks. (Take some notes from Corsair please).The profile switching for recognizing different programs is extremely slow, causes the mouse to freeze up for a few seconds, and can even \"crash\" the mouse and require it to be turned on and off again. Apparently some other uses said this is because Synapse literally uploads the new profile to the mouse every time you switch programs, which is a terrible design. There IS a workaround, made possible by the fact that this mouse has on-board storage. Store the profiles you are using on the mouse's on-board storage, and you can use it without a hitch. However, this is really no excuse for Synapse to suck as there are plenty of other Razer mice that do not have on-board storage.The other big problem with Synapse is that macros do not immediately stop after you release a button - they will continue playing to completion. This severely limits the number of applications where you would choose to use a macro as this makes it too unsafe to use in many situations.Wireless: 10/10 (With the workaround stated above)Great connectivity - extremely reliable and responsive, as long as you use the workaround for Synapse. Switching profiles without the workaround was the only time the mouse would ever hiccup/disconnect. With the work around, it is just as reliable as a wired connection. And when the mouse goes into \"sleep\" mode, I hardly notice a delay when I wake it up.Sensor: 10/10Great sensor, combined with the low weight and low-friction gliding feet the tracking is silky smooth. Lift off distance is extremely low as well and can be further adjusted in Synapse.Weight: 10/10Extremely light. Do I sometimes miss having a sniper button to lower my DPI? Sure. But do I need it with such a light mouse? Certainly not. Any small micro-movements are extremely easy to make and it requires little to no-effort to move this mouse.Battery Life: 10/10I've been using this mouse with the default setting of 33% RGB brightness, and when I'm actively using the mouse at the computer for the whole day (12+ hours), it barely goes down to 70%. For less intensive use, you might last a whole 5 days without charging, or even a whole week. If you turn off the RGB, you could go for even longer._____________________________________________Final remarks:While the shape doesn't quite reach the 10/10 comfort that the Corsair Nightsword is for me, it is still extremely comfortable at a 9/10. Had I not experienced the Nightsword, I might have rated this a 10/10. It is comfortable enough that, combined with being wireless and having optical switches, I am completely sold on it. It is now my new primary mouse.The buttons are great, and I have high hopes for the reliability of the optical switches as Razer is the mouse maker currently using them. Wireless connectivity and and battery life are amazing. Synapse is the only thing that sucks. Razer please fix the software - it's borderline a dealbreaker that makes me reluctant to ever consider Razer products. If you ever see this mouse on sale, I highly recommend it. Just don't ever pay more than $100 for a mouse unless it was signed by Bob Ross."}

This is hands down the best Razer mouse I've used so far and possibly the best mouse I've used as well.  I haven't been on the bandwagon for lighter and lighter weight mice.  Now I might have to jump on that train because the Viper Ultimate is so shockingly light I have a hard time believing that it still works.  Previously I had the Razer Taipan and perceptually it's about 2.5 times heavier.  The transition over has taken a bit of time to get used to but I do like it.  It does feel like you can rapidly change the direction the mouse is moving without much effort and it could lead to better performance playing shooters in particular.Both the Taipan and the Viper Ultimate have rubber grips on the sides of the mouse, and I think It's a really nice feature of both.  I've used wireless mice in the past, a Microsoft one that failed me several times in the heat of battle that used AAA batteries.  I was really unsure about using a wireless mouse again but I figured it was about time to try one again, possibly the technology has improved over the years and certainly it has.  I was tempted by the Razer Orochi v2 but I didn't want to be buying batteries over and over.  I think the Viper Ultimate is a bit better for my personal preferences and I really do like it.  I was watching some YouTube videos analyzing the latency differences between current wireless mice and wired mice.  For the first time I think wireless mice are so competitive with wired mice its there is no major reason to be using a wired mouse outside of cost.  The Razer Viper Ultimate is a great example of this.  There may be a valid argument that the Viper 8k has superior performance over the Viper Ultimate Wireless but the mice refresh rate is so far above what most monitors can display at 1000Hz pooling rate It doesn't feel like there is a major reason to be concerned about it.  Not only that but I've heard the processing required to keep track of the cursor at 8000Hz actually drops your in game frame rate by about 3-4 frames per second (depending on your hardware configuration of course).  I don't see the benefit of a 8000Hz pooling rate right now.  In the end I think it's a great time to transition to a wireless mouse if your interested in it and are able to afford it.I purchased the version of the Viper Ultimate which included the dock and I'm glad I did.  The dock has a magnet on it which makes far easier to rest the mouse on the dock in the correct position for it to charge and you really just don't have to think about dropping the mouse on the dock, the convenience is great.  My only complaint about the dock is that it's so light that sometimes I pull up on the mouse and the dock actually lifts off my desk because the magnet is strong enough to carry the weight of the dock for a few seconds before it drops.  I guess the engineers of the mouse decided to add a sticky pad on the bottom of the dock to help with this but I think this is a lame solution.  A weighted dock design would be far superior in my opinion and hopefully it will be included in a future release.  I don't like the thought of a sticky pad on my desk, it might make a gross sticky mess (which thankfully it hasn't) and possibly will become a hard dusty mass in a few years time anyway.  That's really my biggest complaint with the mouse/dock combo.A minor issue I have with the mouse itself is the Teflon feet.  I wish there was a larger Teflon pad at the back end of the mouse, or maybe two separate feet that are larger that covers that back end area a bit better.  In the past I've used mice for years and years on end before replacing them and the back end of the mouse get's the most feet pad wear (at least for me).  I feel like the Viper Ultimate may not last as long just because the back end feet are not significant enough and they are positioned far to the sides of the mouse, to the point I'll be lifting the mouse up off the mousepad surface and then setting it down, back down back end first and dragging the plastic of the mouse on the plastic mousepad surface for a few moments before the Teflon feet make contact with the mousepad.  This is not ideal in my opinion.Razer synapse, I personally don't mind running software in the background for peripherals as long as it doesn't take up too many system resources and Synapse doesn't.  I HATE the way one has to log into an account to make use of some of the features.  No mouse should require one to create an account to make full use of a mouse, that is a garbage idea for user convenience.  I personally think convenience should be prioritized over most aspects of a products design and this causes me anger every time the synapse software asks me for the password that I usually have forgotten in the weeks that go by where I don't have to enter the password.  Even if I tell it to remember my password the Synapse software still asks me for my password from time to time (I think when it does an update).  It's difficult for me to put into words how rage inducing this is, mostly because it feels so unnecessary.  The software should remember your password no matter what, #1 and #2 you should not need to create an account to make use of mouse software, It's trash on two fronts.  Okay, Razer is a business and they feel like they require minor tracking of their customer base so they can make better business decisions and satisfy customers.  I don't like it at all but hypothetically I can understand.  Message to Razer: Make the Synapse software remember your log in info no matter what.  This software design is just as important as your hardware design work.  For over half of the use of my Razer Taipan I didn't use Synapse at all because it was such a pain in the rear end to make sure I'm logged in all the time.  This may indeed only be an issue with the older version of Synapse, so far I haven't had this issue since purchasing the Viper Ultimate.  I really hope Razer has resolved this and I no longer will be plagued with login requests.In the end very few products are perfect and it is hard to fault the Viper Ultimate Wireless with very much.  I think it's a product worth buying and I'm glad I purchased it, I hope it will last me a few years and be a valuable part of my gaming hardware arsenal.  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing this mouse, I wouldn't hesitate too much, its pretty awesome overall.  It is a bit more pricy compared to some wired options but I do prefer wireless over a corded mouse even with a cord bungie (which are really great by the way).  Definitely consider the Viper Ultimate Wireless mouse if your in the market for a mouse, It's a great option in my opinion, despite my complaints."}
{"asin": "B08565C5BB", "username": "David D.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer Viper Ultimate - No Snake Oil Here, the new King of Mice", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2019", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackStyle: Mouse + Dock", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Razer Viper Ultimate ReviewThis has been a killer year for Razer in their product lineup. From keypads, to keyboards, and now mice as well. The Viper Ultimate is Razer’s one-two punch answer to the Logitech G Pro wireless, which is now getting on over a year old, and it is quite the response. Featuring an incredibly comfortable and sleek ambidextrous design, the Viper Ultimate stands tall amongst its peers, offering one of the best gaming experiences you can have with a mouse.Razer designed the original wired Viper with a key feature set in mind – creating a light, fast, wickedly responsive and premium gaming mouse and the Viper Ultimate adds to that with the addition of wireless connectivity. Long gone are the days of wireless mice being shunned by gamers and only being reserved for travel or general purpose use, wireless mice now stand at the forefront of gaming with offerings from Razer, Corsair, Logitech, Steelseries and other major manufacturers as upgrades to their wired siblings.The Viper and Viper Ultimate offer an extremely comfortable shape and design that really shows how far Razer has come with their mouse design. Subtle comfort grooves in the buttons, crisp button presses, well-stepped mouse wheel, and extremely comfortable rubber sides really make the mouse feel premium. The Viper is ideal for medium to medium-large hands, offering comfortable grip options for both palm, claw, and hybrid grip styles. Fingertip grip is possible here, but not recommended as the mouse as a longer body that is not well suited to fingertip grip styles. Integrated firm rubber sides, textured matte plastic body, and super comfortable shape for left and right handed users really take the spotlight. The mouse has side buttons on both sides, but are cleverly designed so that you never have to worry about accidental presses on either side, and even if you are worried about still somehow hitting the side buttons on the opposite side of the mouse – it is a simple enough task to go into the software and disable them. The mouse is also extremely rigid and sturdy, having no flex or bowing at all, there is a slight rattle but I think it is either in the mouse wheel or lens of the sensor. Not sure though, but it is nothing to be worried about, pretty standard fare there, though I would like to see that eliminated in the future., Lighting is minimal, with the only RGB goodness being the classic Razer logo on the butt of the mouse being lit up, but the charging stand also has an RGB LED on its base and integrates seamlessly into the Razer Chroma ecosystem and works as expected.Ultra low latency, long battery life, and ditching the cable drag are great bullet points for any wireless mouse manufacturer to have – but only a few have managed to add “under 100g” to that list. Logitech launched their G Pro wireless last year with a surprising 78g weight that was lighter than most wired mice, and now that smaller, lighter mice are in – it was the perfect time for Razer to fire back. The Viper Ultimate weighs in at a shockingly light and nimble 74g (2.6 ounces), beating out everything but the Glorious Model O series, the Finalmouse UItralight 2, and the Coolermaster MM710. And at 74g, I would gladly give up my Finalmouse’s ultra-feathery light weight for a better shape and wireless capabilities. I’d also be shocked if we didn’t see an even lighter Viper out next year with the ever popular honey comb design and even lighter materials, I’m almost positive that they could get the weight below 50g with relative ease.So we have a masterful recipe for success here with a great weight and balance, wireless connectivity, and sleek design and shape, but what about the internals?I am glad to say that the inside of the Viper and Viper Ultimate are just as well designed as the outside. The sensor is the result of the partnership between PixArt and Razer, and what they’ve brought with the 3399 is an incredibly fast, accurate, top-of-the line optical sensor that is near flawless in its execution. While the reported resolution of the sensor goes up to a true 20,000 cpi – we all know that none of us will ever even come close to using that level of granularity given that the overwhelming majority of gamers use 2000 dpi or lower. But it is nice to know that the option is there – in the event that we have 20K displays. The bottom is equipped with pure 100% PTFE feet without any dye positioned at the corners of the mouse and around the sensor itself. The absence of the black dye means there is zero grittiness to the glide of the mouse when moving it, and rivals that of aftermarket mouse feet like Hyperglides. The only reason you’ll ever need to replace these feet is if they ever wear out, they’re as good as mouse feet get. The clicks are satisfying and tactile, offering an instant response due to their opto-electric nature. Speaking of which, the opto-electric switches are great! Because there are no actual contacts, the switches have an incredibly long lifespan, over 50 million clicks and are immune to double-clicking that their mechanical microswitch brethren are notorious for.Included with the mouse is a charging dock that functions both as a home for the wireless receiver if you so choose and as a convenient and fast way to charge the mouse when not in use. Simply plop the mouse on the dock when you walk away to get a drink or go to bed, it is as simple as that – not that you’ll need to do that very often. The Viper Ultimate sports a staggeringly impressive maximum battery life of 70+ hours on one charge, and can be charged from 0-80% in 90 minutes or less. The cable used to plug into the charging dock can be used to connect the mouse directly to the computer to be used in a wired state, if you for some reason should want to do that. It is very lightweight and flexible, only ever so slightly stiffer than the Viper wired cable. Let’s be real here though, if you’re buying a wireless mouse only to plug it in and use it wired, what are you doing?At $150, it might be a tough purchase for some – but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it. If you are looking for the absolute best wireless gaming mouse out there right now, the Viper Ultimate is it. There is little room for debate on whether or not the Viper Ultimate is the king of gaming mice in 2019. Ultimately though, the best mouse for you is the one that feels best in your hand. So many mice have top optical sensors and similar specs, that it comes down to personal preference in regards to the shape. For me, the Viper Ultimate shape fits my hands extraordinarily well, whereas the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 and Logitech G Pro wireless exist at opposite ends of comfort for me. The Ultralight 2 is too small for my hands, and the G Pro feels too much like a semi-circular plastic dome, but the Viper Ultimate is just right.If there’s anything I would consider changing it would be creating a honey-comb shell design that would further reduce the weight and possibly making the side buttons modular, similar to that of Logitech’s offerings so that if we so choose to could simply remove the side buttons for the side of the mouse that we are not using.Razer, 2019 is the year you came back hard. I love what you’re offering and I really hope 2020 brings as much if not more innovation to your future product lines. You guys are champions, once more."}

VERY nice to not have to deal with a wire anymore and not have any downsides.+ Good customization within Synapse such as button programming, lighting, power-saving mode threshold, custom DPI, lift-off distance, etc.+ Saving to onboard memory is great, as is having the option to log in to synapse as Guest.+ Different methods of using and charging the mouse is really nice.+ Feet are good. No issues and glide nicely on a QCK Heavy. Texture on the shell is good and grippy. I prefer this textured plastic over a rubber coating. Rubber sides feel good. Grippy and not mushy at all. Mouse wheel has good feedback and feels good to scroll (for now) and has a nice grippy texture. Side buttons and scroll wheel feel pretty good to click and the NORMAL ones aren't in the way (left side for right-handed, right side for left-handed). There's no play/travel distance on the side buttons like there is on some mice like my old EC2-A.+ Battery life seems good. Going to actually test it now on full charge with lighting off but so far it seems as-advertised, at least for the most part.- After leaving it charging all night through the direct connection and from maybe around 20%, Synapse only read a 97% charge. I restarted Synapse to see if it was reading wrong but it still read 97%. I placed it on the dock for a few minutes and it fully charged to 100%. Not sure what that's about but thought I'd mention it. Will test this more.- Unsure if it's just Windows 7 not playing nice with it, but when switching modes, the mouse sometimes doesn't allow me to interact with things outside of my online browser. For example,  I'll switch from wired to wireless mode and I'll be able to move my cursor and interact with my  browser but NOTHING else is interactable until I restart the Windows explorer process. I can't highlight icons, close or open programs, windows or anything. Very strange and really hope this won't be an ongoing issue.- Could be an issue on my end but Synapse doesn't recognize the mouse or dock on either of my USB 3.0 ports. ONLY when I use the wireless receiver by itself does it recognize the mouse in Synapse. If the receiver is in the dock or even if the wire is connected directly to the mouse, Synapse will not pick it up. I still have function but can't change any settings until I use a USB 2 port. Ports work fine with other hardware.- Just a few days in and, though still good, the mouse wheel has slightly lost some of it's  snappiness in it's scroll and the left and right clicks have developed a slight give. Somewhat  nitpicking here, but I would really hate it if the mouse felt like crap to use in just a few months.  For the price, this things should be rock solid for years and not develop that mushy cheapness.- Didn't think I would, but I constantly press the sidebuttons on the right side when I'm aiming (I use it in my right hand). I had to disable them through Synapse. Thankfully you can and then save the setting to internal  memory. Unfortunately, I can't use them now for other things if I wanted to, such as  volume control.- Some part of the Razer software (Razer Synapse Service Process) stays running even after you select \"Exit All Apps\" from the  tray icon. This happened with my old Razer Naga too. Normally, I wouldn't care THAT much, but this particular process KILLS fps in my games. I literally have to end the process or games stutter like crazy for some reason, or at least Overwatch does.- Really just personal opinion, but it'd be nice if Razer would make some smaller mice. Pretty much all of their mice are too big in one way or another for someone with smaller hands and depending on how you grip. This one is just a bit too long for me personally.Overall, I think if it lasts and the shell doesn't become mushy and creaky like it very well may with enough use, it's everything a competitive FPS player would ever need IF (big if) the mouse fits your hand well. Measure your hands and decide for yourself. Mine are roughly...H 7.25 inches x W 4.25 inches (H 18.415 cm x W 10.795 cm)3 finger width (index, middle, ring) =  2.125 inches (5.3975 cm)Middle finger + knuckle = 4 1/4 inches (10.795 cm)And I probably fall somewhere between claw and fingertip grip, probably leaning more towards fingertip.--------------------------------------------So far, for me, after less than one week with the mouse:Performance: 10/10Comfort: 6.5/10 (subjective and also still getting used to the shape so likely to go up, but hitting sidebuttons accidentally sucks - also my first ambidextrous)Feedback: 8.5/10 (this will get lower if the shell quality doesn't hold and the snappiness diminishes)Quality: 8/10 (mostly concerned about long-term quality here as left/right buttons already have some slight give/shake to them after a few days of use and the scroll doesn't feel like it's going to hold it's feeling of precision and snappiness in it's steps - otherwise though, pretty solid)Software: 7/10 (good options but a little too bloated - can thankfully choose which software you'd like to install)Value: 7/10 (I got it on sale for $120 but I think it's worth more around $100 - if it was perfect for my hand and grip, $120 would be kind of okay maybe, however twice the price of the wired is high enough - full price is simply too much and in the end, I might come to regret not just buying two $60 mice and a bungee)Currently, this mouse is hovering around an 8 or 8.5/10 for me. This is likely to go up to a 9 with use and as I get used to it's size and shape, just as long as quality and performance stays the same as it is now. Overall I commend Razer for innovating and listening to it's customers and I hope to enjoy this mouse with no issue for years to come."}

That should say how much I use my mouse, not counting how rough I am on my mice, such as when sliding & lifting them across my mouse-pad or the occasional accidental drop. This lead me to typically only buy Razer mice, because all of the other main brand mice usually break around the 5 month mark for me.This is not to mention my original Razer Deathadder V1 mouse lasted 7 years of VERY harsh daily use, and only failed because its scroll-wheel broke. (Abbreviating Deathadder to DA from now on)That's not to say I haven't had issues with Razer products, my first DA V2 lasted 1 week until both the left click and the scroll wheel started failing leading me to then use the other brand name mice; G502 Hero lasted 5 months, Corsair M55 lasted 2 weeks,and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste lasted 3 months.My next Razer product was a DA V2 pro and that one lasted 2 years, Which led me to buy this one after that one started not sensing right clicks.Issues:I had zero issues with it for 8 months, then, entirely out of random, started having weird issues with connectivity.  This started out with very minuscule connectivity issues, such as it waiting 30 seconds for my PC and Razer's software to start working properly to use the mouse when it gets turned on after being off for a while.This was annoying, but I didn't care too much about that since I could still do whatever I needed to do.But fast forward ~4 months and the issues have compounded a little bit and I get my connection cut off when playing games for a solid 4 seconds at a time, and at this point this is getting REALLY annoying to endure (This happens plugged in too).At this point I am also having issues with the mouse having a slowed reception & it being able to hold a charge for more than half a day. I used to be able to use it at it's highest pulling rate and low brightness of the LED for 5 days without charging.Positives:Very durable plastic, I have very little wear on the mouse besides a bit of wear on the left click plastic making it shiny instead of matte black.Very comfortable if you claw grip your mouse (Not comfortable if you palm the entire mouse).Very light and easy to move on a mouse-pad.Fairly priced, ~$60 is quite decent for this mouse.Lasted 10 Months until having some bigger issues (Most mice completely break around the 5th month for me).Scroll wheel is perfect, zero squeaking (like a Corsair M55) or aggressive rumble feeling (like a Logitech G502) and has a good rubberized texture to it (HyperX Pulsefire haste didn't have any great texturing).Great for putting into a schoolbag for college or for storing in a laptop case.Buttons and sensor are great and feel immaculate.Cons:Either the USB dongle, or the mouse itself is having issues cutting out and not working at random after close to a year of use. The same with sensitivity, it has definitely gone down for the sensor.Battery is now starting to have issues holding a charge.This is where I am currently at with this mouse, It has worked very well for what it is, but I may soon have to upgrade, due to the issues I am having.You will probably have a longer service life on your mouse though, especially if you are not rough on your electronics.I would 100% recommend this if you need it for a laptop and need it to be wireless, or have smaller hands that are not as fitting for a Razer Deathadder."}

If you play a song that some guy hit the bass drum once, the cursor is moving on you. I've been playing FPS games all of my life, but I can't get the flick down for this mouse; the lack of weight gives 0 feedback to your hand. You are basically reactionary to everything. By that, I mean move the mouse first, react to how the screen moves, then adjust accordingly.

The battery life is incredibly good averaging about 10-12 hours before needing a charge, and Razer software gives you a healthy heads up when your battery is getting low, so there's never a concern for it dying in game. The connection speed is incredibly fast, 0 notable latency while wireless, and it shows the same speed while wired and charging. My only complaint (which isn't worthy of being a complaint) is that the Razer symbol that glows, gets covered by your own hands, so you cant really see any of the LED effects that you set up."}

This mouse however, feels great and I love it.  I bought this to replace my Glorious Model O mouse because I wanted to go wireless.  It's amazing that this wireless mouse is only about 6 grams heavier than the Model O and it doesn't even need to have the hexagonal pattern on the case to remove weight.I spend a lot of time in first-person shooters like Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield when I'm not at my desktop doing normal daily web browsing and email reading.Here are some pros:- Feels very light, especially for a wireless mouse.- I don't sense any delay, even after I leave it sitting for a while.- It's very convenient to have a power button on the bottom of the mouse, and to have a charging dock to sit it on when not in use.- The button clicks are very satisfying - good sound, good force needed (not too much or too little for my taste).- Lighting is tasteful and not too overdone.- The finish on the mouse is nice to the touch - grippy on the sides, and smoothly textured elsewhere.- The side buttons are well-placed for my thumb.  Others have been a little too far forward for me.- The battery life seems great. I am part-way through my fifth day of use and the battery is at 51%.  I have been using it to play games every day for at least 3-5 hours per night plus regular Desktop duties for at least an hour each day as well.  I have not recharged it yet and I turn off the power at the end of each day when I am done with the mouse for the night.- The Synapse software is much better than I expected and has not crashed for me once.  It's pretty easy to understand and laid out fairly well.  It's great that it will change profiles for me automatically based on the games I start up, then go back to my \"desktop\" profile after I close the game.Here are some cons (for mouse, and Synapse software):- I miss the extra button on top of the mouse that my Model O had.  I wish this mouse had that extra button near the scroll wheel.  I have had to use one of the right-side buttons instead.  Although the right-side buttons are not as easy to press for me (since I'm a right-handed user) I'm getting used to them for desktop use.- I find the lighting options a bit confusing with regards to the \"Quick\" effects and the \"Advanced\" effects in the Synapse software.  Mostly, it's frustrating that only the Quick effects are stored on the mouse with the profiles and not the Advanced effects.  I think this means that if you want to use any of the Advanced effects, they will not be saved on the mouse and I'm not sure if they can be tied to games like the other profiles.  Before I can really fault the mouse or software for this one, I suppose I need to learn how to use it more.  Either way, I wish it were a little simpler to understand for first-time Synapse users like me.- I wish the mouse feet were \"slipperier\".  Compared to my Model O mouse, this mouse does not move across my cloth mouse mat as easily.  My no means is it \"not\" slippery, but it was noticeably less slippery when I was swapping them out.  Now that I have not used my Model O for about 5 days, I don't notice it any more or have any issues moving the mouse, but it would be nice to know that it was at least as free to move as the Model O.  This might turn into a plus as I get used to it because it may give me a little more \"control\".To summarize, I love this mouse!  It's been great to use so far and I'm very glad I switched back to this wireless option.  Lot's to like here and the software (despite some shortcomings) is much better than I expected and seems mostly mature and works well."}

It is balanced, light, and efficient (talk about that battery life). I find that if you don't find the extra money with the Viper V2, the Viper Ultimate will do just fine as personally I find the V2 not very much of an upgrade over this (I've never used the V2 though). I have nothing to dislike about this apart from maybe the left-side mouse buttons as I'm a righty but like I said, I use a fingertip grip so I don't mind it most of the time unless I palm the mouse.

The battery life on the mouse is fine and will last you all day, but the charger is annoying. Both of my brothers purchased this mouse previously, and we all had our charging docks randomly stop working after months of use. What happens is the mouse will charge for a second which wakes it up, then stop and loop that so it’s constantly on all night and just dies. The past few times I turned on my computer, I would take the mouse off the charger, just to see it blinking red and require a charge. The charger seems to work almost all of the time, but for some reason, it refuses to charge at night and will drain the battery. My brothers both had to get different mice, and I think I need to do the same. It does come with a wire so that you can use the mouse wired, but that defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse obv. We could've just bought another charger, but at that point, I'll just get a new more reliable wireless mouse.

The battery life is incredibly good averaging about 10-12 hours before needing a charge, and Razer software gives you a healthy heads up when your battery is getting low, so there's never a concern for it dying in game. The connection speed is incredibly fast, 0 notable latency while wireless, and it shows the same speed while wired and charging. My only complaint (which isn't worthy of being a complaint) is that the Razer symbol that glows, gets covered by your own hands, so you cant really see any of the LED effects that you set up."}

The problem is the charging cradle frequently fails to charge the mouse despite being careful to ensure it is seated correctly on the cradle, as a result I will often have to plug the mouse in instead of it having recharged overnight. I have taken to keeping a cheap corded mouse plugged in for emergencies where the charging cradle failed to charge the mouse.

The G903 sits higher and that's what I prefer.  The Razer is a lower profile which I will need to get used to.  I am not using this for gaming, although I may try it out.  For left handed mousing it's a good option.  I do like the subtle RGB lighting.  Normally, I hate this trend of multi-color lights.

This mouse however, feels great and I love it.  I bought this to replace my Glorious Model O mouse because I wanted to go wireless.  It's amazing that this wireless mouse is only about 6 grams heavier than the Model O and it doesn't even need to have the hexagonal pattern on the case to remove weight.I spend a lot of time in first-person shooters like Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield when I'm not at my desktop doing normal daily web browsing and email reading.Here are some pros:- Feels very light, especially for a wireless mouse.- I don't sense any delay, even after I leave it sitting for a while.- It's very convenient to have a power button on the bottom of the mouse, and to have a charging dock to sit it on when not in use.- The button clicks are very satisfying - good sound, good force needed (not too much or too little for my taste).- Lighting is tasteful and not too overdone.- The finish on the mouse is nice to the touch - grippy on the sides, and smoothly textured elsewhere.- The side buttons are well-placed for my thumb.  Others have been a little too far forward for me.- The battery life seems great. I am part-way through my fifth day of use and the battery is at 51%.  I have been using it to play games every day for at least 3-5 hours per night plus regular Desktop duties for at least an hour each day as well.  I have not recharged it yet and I turn off the power at the end of each day when I am done with the mouse for the night.- The Synapse software is much better than I expected and has not crashed for me once.  It's pretty easy to understand and laid out fairly well.  It's great that it will change profiles for me automatically based on the games I start up, then go back to my \"desktop\" profile after I close the game.Here are some cons (for mouse, and Synapse software):- I miss the extra button on top of the mouse that my Model O had.  I wish this mouse had that extra button near the scroll wheel.  I have had to use one of the right-side buttons instead.  Although the right-side buttons are not as easy to press for me (since I'm a right-handed user) I'm getting used to them for desktop use.- I find the lighting options a bit confusing with regards to the \"Quick\" effects and the \"Advanced\" effects in the Synapse software.  Mostly, it's frustrating that only the Quick effects are stored on the mouse with the profiles and not the Advanced effects.  I think this means that if you want to use any of the Advanced effects, they will not be saved on the mouse and I'm not sure if they can be tied to games like the other profiles.  Before I can really fault the mouse or software for this one, I suppose I need to learn how to use it more.  Either way, I wish it were a little simpler to understand for first-time Synapse users like me.- I wish the mouse feet were \"slipperier\".  Compared to my Model O mouse, this mouse does not move across my cloth mouse mat as easily.  My no means is it \"not\" slippery, but it was noticeably less slippery when I was swapping them out.  Now that I have not used my Model O for about 5 days, I don't notice it any more or have any issues moving the mouse, but it would be nice to know that it was at least as free to move as the Model O.  This might turn into a plus as I get used to it because it may give me a little more \"control\".To summarize, I love this mouse!  It's been great to use so far and I'm very glad I switched back to this wireless option.  Lot's to like here and the software (despite some shortcomings) is much better than I expected and seems mostly mature and works well."}

It is balanced, light, and efficient (talk about that battery life). I find that if you don't find the extra money with the Viper V2, the Viper Ultimate will do just fine as personally I find the V2 not very much of an upgrade over this (I've never used the V2 though). I have nothing to dislike about this apart from maybe the left-side mouse buttons as I'm a righty but like I said, I use a fingertip grip so I don't mind it most of the time unless I palm the mouse.

I love this mouse and bought it around a year ago, with little to no issues.The only real complaint I have is the charging dock. The battery life on the mouse is fine and will last you all day, but the charger is annoying. Both of my brothers purchased this mouse previously, and we all had our charging docks randomly stop working after months of use. What happens is the mouse will charge for a second which wakes it up, then stop and loop that so it’s constantly on all night and just dies. The past few times I turned on my computer, I would take the mouse off the charger, just to see it blinking red and require a charge. The charger seems to work almost all of the time, but for some reason, it refuses to charge at night and will drain the battery. My brothers both had to get different mice, and I think I need to do the same. It does come with a wire so that you can use the mouse wired, but that defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse obv. We could've just bought another charger, but at that point, I'll just get a new more reliable wireless mouse. All in all, not a bad mouse, just a bad charging unit that seems to not be functional for many after around a year of use."}

Now openrazer and Polychromatic work well on Linux with the v1, v2 and v3 models.  No need for the \"profile\" button, but I do use the two little buttons below the scroll wheel to change sensitivity now and again.The v2 added left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, and a manual friction adjustment on the scroll wheel.  I never use the tilt, but getting the scroll wheel friction just right is very nice.Then I bought this v3.  One step forward, one step back.  The friction adjustment is gone, and 3 months later I still miss it.  I now use the \"smart wheel\" mode, and 3 months later it still surprises me.  I can sort of predict when the wheel friction will go away and infinite scroll mode starts.  After a bit, the scroll wheel friction comes back with a little click, but the infinite scroll mode stays on.  If I move the mouse to another window then, the window will also infinite scroll, and that is never what I want.  Some indeterminate time later, the infinite scroll turns off, with no indication that has happened.The infinite scroll mode is really useful for many web pages, but too hard to use most of the time.Given the choice, I might buy a v2 instead of the v3 next time.

I set the blink rate for insertion point, click rates, etc.  I do NOT have the Razer application(s) running via the System Tray (turn them off thru Task Manager / Startup). I can activate the apps any time via the Start Menu / Razer folder. I DO recommend setting up a Razer profile, but you don't have to stay logged in. If I recall, I setup my profile to register my mouse (Razer Basilisk v3).To give the fancy mouse a nice parking spot, I bought a new (gaming) mouse pad, roughly 8\"x10\". It's totally not necessary, but the new pad makes the mouse space look fresh. (Machine washing my old mouse pad does the same, but I digress.)If you're tired of mini-mice and unresponsive mice and boring mice, I encourage this one be put to task.

Kind of a no-brainer for anyone who doesn't want to spend 100 bucks, but wants top-of-the-line quality.Despite the negative reviews, the Synapse software is actually solid. It tells you to log in, but you don't need to log in to use it. So just ignore that prompt. All the buttons are rebindable.

This isn't just a wireless gaming mouse, it's a revolutionary device that blends comfort, precision, and personalization.Its ergonomic design was the first thing that drew me in. The mouse nestles perfectly in my hand, providing comfort during extended gaming marathons. While the design is primarily tailored for larger hands, I found it quite comfortable even with my average-sized hands.The HyperScroll Tilt Wheel and 11 programmable buttons are the standout features. The tilt wheel's dual-mode allows for a switch between tactile and free-spin scrolling, offering a versatile user experience. The programmable buttons let me tailor my gaming preferences, boosting my speed and efficiency.The Focus Pro 30K Sensor and Fast Optical Switches Gen-3 are the crowning features of this mouse. The upgraded sensor and switches deliver an impressively low click latency, leading to a highly responsive gaming experience. The sensor's performance is top-notch, making it an ideal choice for FPS gaming.The Chroma RGB lighting lends a visual charm to the mouse, transforming it from a mere device to an integral part of my gaming setup's character.However, the Basilisk V3 Pro does come with a substantial price tag. The wireless charging dock and HyperPolling dongle are sold separately, which adds to the overall cost. Despite the steep price, I believe the features and performance make it a worthwhile investment.In conclusion, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a high-end gaming mouse that offers a mix of comfort, customization, and superior performance. It's a valuable investment for any serious gamer seeking to enhance their gaming experience.Additionally, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is compatible with the Anker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad) https://amzn.to/46WLdMZ which offers 10W Max Fast Charging.

The worse thing is, when you turn off Synapse, the RGB settings disappears as well only to return when you open the app again.Onboard memory only works for the mouse buttons itself, the dpi etc., all the important things except the RGB which you can only turn off or leave at default rgb cycle (one color one by one, not the rainbow rgb in the picture). People online have searched for solutions with minor success by using openrazer or other applications to set the rgb on the onboard memory so they are sure it's not a hardware limitation but more of a choice by Razer so that you continue using Synapse.This is a deal breaker for some people, especially those that don't want bloatware on their pc but for me, it's worth it for the minor inconvenience because the RGB itself is a thing of beauty.The performance of the mouse is also superb so I will continue being a fan of this mouse."}

I set the blink rate for insertion point, click rates, etc.  I do NOT have the Razer application(s) running via the System Tray (turn them off thru Task Manager / Startup). I can activate the apps any time via the Start Menu / Razer folder. I DO recommend setting up a Razer profile, but you don't have to stay logged in. If I recall, I setup my profile to register my mouse (Razer Basilisk v3).To give the fancy mouse a nice parking spot, I bought a new (gaming) mouse pad, roughly 8\"x10\". It's totally not necessary, but the new pad makes the mouse space look fresh. (Machine washing my old mouse pad does the same, but I digress.)If you're tired of mini-mice and unresponsive mice and boring mice, I encourage this one be put to task. From its quality feel and look, and its impressive ergonomic design, I'll be enjoying it for years ahead."}

It has great ergonomics (as long as you're a righty), good cord design that resists binding and tangles, and has rubber sides and finger indentations to prevent your hand from slipping. It is ideal for work because you can rebind the numerous extra buttons to copy, paste, or to open specific files or programs, etc. For gaming, because of the cord, it doesn't have any heavy AA batteries, wi-fi issues, or a need to recharge for five hours. Kind of a no-brainer for anyone who doesn't want to spend 100 bucks, but wants top-of-the-line quality.Despite the negative reviews, the Synapse software is actually solid. It tells you to log in, but you don't need to log in to use it. So just ignore that prompt. All the buttons are rebindable. The lighting is cool and is customizable, but unless you want to annoy your pet and have them attack it, it is otherwise pointless."}

This isn't just a wireless gaming mouse, it's a revolutionary device that blends comfort, precision, and personalization.Its ergonomic design was the first thing that drew me in. The mouse nestles perfectly in my hand, providing comfort during extended gaming marathons. While the design is primarily tailored for larger hands, I found it quite comfortable even with my average-sized hands.The HyperScroll Tilt Wheel and 11 programmable buttons are the standout features. The tilt wheel's dual-mode allows for a switch between tactile and free-spin scrolling, offering a versatile user experience. The programmable buttons let me tailor my gaming preferences, boosting my speed and efficiency.The Focus Pro 30K Sensor and Fast Optical Switches Gen-3 are the crowning features of this mouse. The upgraded sensor and switches deliver an impressively low click latency, leading to a highly responsive gaming experience. The sensor's performance is top-notch, making it an ideal choice for FPS gaming.The Chroma RGB lighting lends a visual charm to the mouse, transforming it from a mere device to an integral part of my gaming setup's character.However, the Basilisk V3 Pro does come with a substantial price tag. The wireless charging dock and HyperPolling dongle are sold separately, which adds to the overall cost. Despite the steep price, I believe the features and performance make it a worthwhile investment.In conclusion, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a high-end gaming mouse that offers a mix of comfort, customization, and superior performance. It's a valuable investment for any serious gamer seeking to enhance their gaming experience.Additionally, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is compatible with the Anker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad) https://amzn.to/46WLdMZ which offers 10W Max Fast Charging. If you’re exploring wireless charging solutions, the Razer Wireless Charging Puck for the Basilisk V3 Pro Gaming Mouse is worth considering.Affiliate link to both products:The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro: https://amzn.to/3QI67tsAnker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad): https://amzn.to/46WLdMZ"}

The color options are endless, the different presets are gorgeous, its bright, dim, and everything in between. I have the brightness set to about 50% and its still so beyond beautiful. I got it for my office job to add a bit of light and joy to my desk and I love changing the color combinations depending on my mood. It is the wired so no worries of battery life and the way the cord is made, it doesn’t pull on the mouse and cause dragging at all. It works with or without a mousepad which i LOVE. Will definitely be ordering another when i get a home PC!"}

The worse thing is, when you turn off Synapse, the RGB settings disappears as well only to return when you open the app again.Onboard memory only works for the mouse buttons itself, the dpi etc., all the important things except the RGB which you can only turn off or leave at default rgb cycle (one color one by one, not the rainbow rgb in the picture). People online have searched for solutions with minor success by using openrazer or other applications to set the rgb on the onboard memory so they are sure it's not a hardware limitation but more of a choice by Razer so that you continue using Synapse.This is a deal breaker for some people, especially those that don't want bloatware on their pc but for me, it's worth it for the minor inconvenience because the RGB itself is a thing of beauty.The performance of the mouse is also superb so I will continue being a fan of this mouse."}

So I gave up on the idea and bought a g502.Fast forward a few years and Razer comes out with this mouse (the ballisk 3) and it's basically a clone of the logitech g502 only with a clutch scroll wheel, and I hoped Razer was better at making those scroll wheels, so I buy one, and it's a great mouse, but the scroll wheel on it too died after a year and a half (it got stuck in free-spin). But Razer replaced it for free (though I did have to send them a video of the problem, which was too much work).So anyway, it's a great mouse, but it'll die after 18 months, but the warranty covers it for 24, so I guess you're paying for 36 months of mouse, and at some point in time you're going to have to produce a video demonstrating the problem (which is hard because the scroll wheel doesn't really look different when it's spinning, so you'll need to put a sticker on it or something.)Anywho, if that sounds alright to you, it really is a great mouse: Basically a slightly better version of the g502 with a clutch scroll wheel."}

I looked around for a while and didn't find anything helpful in support and ended up ordering another mouse and setup a return for the original. While waiting for the new one to come in I tried a couple of different things and ended up getting it working. My guess is that the mouse wasn't paired to the dongle from the factory for whatever reason, very annoying. If you go to razers website and to the Razer Mice and Keyboards USB HyperSpeed Dongle product page there is a link to download the pairing software which is what worked for me. On a side note, the new mouse connected fine and didn't need to be paired."}

My only real complaint is the design of the scroll wheel, which I just do not understand. It worked well for about a year and a half, but around the 18-month mark the wheel started \"slipping\". It wasn't like a problem with the sensors(as the razer website will tell you), it was almost like the rubber grip was sliding without turning the wheel. It didn't happen all the time, just on occasion I'd miss a few clicks when scrolling. Not a problem for browsing the internet, a bit of a problem for gaming. When I went to try to figure out what was wrong, I realized that the rubber grip on the wheel is literally just a ring of rubber, completely smooth and flat on the bottom. It's just sitting on a band of smooth metal. The metal is completely clean, as is the underside of the rubber, leading me to believe that there wasn't even any adhesive. They just put a smooth rubber band on smooth metal and.... hoped for the best? I just don't get it. I guess the friction from how tight the band was worked for a bit, but obviously, with time, the rubber has relaxed slightly. It doesn't take much for smooth rubber to slip on smooth metal. I mean, I can't be that mad because it was a fairly cheap mouse that's been pretty high quality, I just don't get why a bit of adhesive or a rough surface was not considered. Seems like a huge oversight, and not an especially expensive design change."}

It does what I need it to do.  I got this one because it has an on/off button, so that I can turn it off when I don't need it to jiggle. However, there are a few things to know about this jiggler.The \"slight\" jiggler mode moves the mouse cursor about once every second.  Sometimes just one pixel to the right, then a second later one pixel to the left.  Other times, it will move the cursor two pixels to the left, then a second later one pixel right, then another second later one pixel right again.The \"random\" jiggler mode, really is not random. It moves in a strange repeating multi triangle pattern where every few loops it gains about 10 pixels to the left and 10 pixels down.  So when you leave it in this mode, one minute later you will find the cursor wiggling around somewhere near the lower left corner of your screen.Also it can be a bit difficult to get used to turning it off and on.  It's not that easy to always press and hold the button just long enough to turn it off.  Sometimes I would think it was off, but rather I didn't press the button long enough, or maybe I pressed it too long.  It would switch modes and I'd have to try again to turn it off."}

In terms of standard or heavier mice, this one is one of the nicest ones I have ever used. It glides across my Razer mouse mat like ice. Extremely customizable for how it looks. Every feature is completely hidden, and very well at that. The back plate and front click plates come off to change weight and click switches respectively. Uses very nice custom designed click switches that are sold separately for replacement but you get 2 pairs with the mouse, so your first replacement is free. That is generally what goes bad on mice first, so this is basically when most would buy a new mouse, but now it is easy enough to fix you do not need a new one.In terms of specs, this is of the highest caliber as well. The 36k DPI sensor is the highest spec on the market and is the most capable of high performance gaming on the market competing with the dual sensor 12K DPI system of the Steelseries mice. Optical sensor so no problems with hair getting in there blocking a laser. Comes with plastic skates but they perform well. I have a feeling replacing these with ceramic or glass skates will make the mouse feel even more premium like my RAT8+. Overall the performance in games for me gets a 4/5 because the weights do not go low enough to get a true lightweight experience on the mouse.The build quality is a 5/5 though and the looks are an easy 4/5 or 5/5 depending on taste, if you like the looks anyways.  I like RGB and you can turn it off. It does look a little basic without RGB, so that might be a 3/5. Armory crate is a mixed bag of an experience I am seeing, truly. I would not let the Armory crate dissuade anyone from getting this, unless they have a known interfering software like in some cases MSI Center and/or Corsair iCue."}

Luckily most of the buttons near there I've just mapped to pause and play videos so it's not that big of a downside.I've had to get used to this new style of gripping the mouse. It did cause my hand some slight pain and discomfort initially. But having used it for close to a month now I've gotten used to it and my hand feels comfortable with it now.PROS:- USB C (my previous corsair mouse had micro USB so having USB C is definitely an upgrade as well as having it charge while plugged in.)- Magnetic Charging stand (Feels great not having to plug my mouse into any wires and just having it snap to the magnetic stand is satisfying. I put my charging stand flat on my table since it's easier to remove the mouse without moving the stand that way.)- Battery life (I had it running for quite a few days before its battery got low. compared to my corsair one which usually lasted around a day. You can also configure the app to let the mouse's lights start flashing whenever the battery gets low to notify you.)CONS:- Large/shape might feel awkward to use at first (Gets better as time goes on but ultimately this will be dependent on the person that uses it)- Side buttons might feel like they are in an awkward spot when trying to lift the mouse which can lead to accidental button presses."}

It takes a long time to load even on high end systems and seems to crash 20% of the time or has to constantly reload.  The Software will refuse to allow you to change settings if you haven't updated everything included.  The mouse itself is great and of good build quality.  It's for bigger hands so if you have average or small hands using the joystick on the side is a bit difficult.  Some reviewers state you can't switch profiles without the Armoury Crate software but that's incorrect.  The manual has a brief rundown of how to save profiles, with the software installed, and then switch profiles when the software is not installed, which you'll probably need to do as having the software is such a pain.  You can assign the joystick to be either an analog stick like a controller or have it act as a 4 way hat with different functions assigned to each direction(media keys KB buttons etc.)  The four side buttons are placed a little awkwardly and I have a feeling they should have been stacked more closely together for comfort but they are acceptable and not awful.  Scroll wheel feels nice and apparently has it's own color scheme in the LED options.  And boy this thing has lots of preset and customizable lighting effects.  One of the main if not the main draw for me on this mouse is the replaceable mouse switches.  You get two sets in the box, one set installed and another type that I haven't tried yet but are said to be of a different feel and connection type.  More mice need to do this.  This would resolve every double clicking issue if you could just easily replace switches to repair the mouse.  DPI switch made very easy by the buttons on the bottom and with the software installed will tell you which profile you are on through window notification.  All in all a really good customizable mouse with tons of features.  The software works but is so slow or at times crash prone that this is the only real downfall of the product.  Asus seriously needs to optimize this software, it feels as if it's a webpage loading and i'm on mid 90s internet at times.

And so far, the mouse has delivered just that, a premium gaming experience. I'm coming from a Red Dragon MMO Mouse which I'll admit I was skeptical, but was honestly a great purchase for the money. I still wanted something more gamer-esque, reliable, and more importantly wireless. So far the ASUS Spatha X has had great wireless connection, a comfortable grip, and decent customizable options through the Armory Crate (ASUS) app. It also allows for macros for those that like/need to set up multiple key binds to one button. The Mouse is a little heavier than your typical gaming mice but it feels really comfortable in my hand as it gives me a greater sense of control when I flick my wrist around. If you are one of those people that \"lift\" their mouses around quite a bit when gaming, this is probably not the mouse for you as this does require a firmer grip to do so and may lead to accidental clicking of buttons (FYI. the buttons can easily be disabled.). Speaking of the button, they seem a little unorthodox at first but you quickly get accustomed to them (will vary by person though). The side buttons are actually well placed and easy to reach so kudos to that ASUS for that since not all Mice get button placement right the first time around (I'm looking at you G502 Hero). I have had ZERO drop of wireless connectivity in my gaming sessions (Shooters, MMOs, etc.) but will gladly update the review if I experience any in the future. Keep in mind that I also have almost 10 different wi-fi devices around me (6x6 ft) and have experienced no interference of any kind WHATSOEVER which was my biggest worry coming into a big purchase like this. Now price....Is the Mouse worth 150 bones? Well there are definitely other options that work and feel just as great for 50 or more dollars less. I myself almost settled on a g502 x plus which is one of,if not, THE logitech top of the line mouse, but decided against it since it felt a tad bit too small in my hand. All n all, The ASUS Spatha X is a great mouse that will excite even the pickiest PC gamers and if you don't agree, COME FIGHT ME!!!"}

Only the middle button on the side is hard for me to press.- Charging Stand - This was the selling point for me.

I have not charged and have been using for 4 days (hours each day) and it shows I am still over the 60% battery mark.Cons:- The USB-A to USB-C cables that come with the mouse are trash.

I could get maybe 14 feet away from the stand at my PC desk (couch location), and the buttons started to not register with the PC anymore.  Had to move the charging stand to the far side of the desk (around 9 feet) for it to reach the couch.  I have a $20 wireless keyboard from Walmart that uses a USB-A dongle for Wi-Fi, and it can reach farther away than this $150 mouse.- Software - It took me 2 hours to download the software to program the mouse.  This is downloading it directly from the ASUS website.  It would start and fail.  Restarting my PC each time because after it failed it would not even attempt to install again.  Uninstall software and try again.... start, get a little further, and fail.

In terms of standard or heavier mice, this one is one of the nicest ones I have ever used. It glides across my Razer mouse mat like ice. Extremely customizable for how it looks. Every feature is completely hidden, and very well at that. The back plate and front click plates come off to change weight and click switches respectively. Uses very nice custom designed click switches that are sold separately for replacement but you get 2 pairs with the mouse, so your first replacement is free. That is generally what goes bad on mice first, so this is basically when most would buy a new mouse, but now it is easy enough to fix you do not need a new one.In terms of specs, this is of the highest caliber as well. The 36k DPI sensor is the highest spec on the market and is the most capable of high performance gaming on the market competing with the dual sensor 12K DPI system of the Steelseries mice. Optical sensor so no problems with hair getting in there blocking a laser. Comes with plastic skates but they perform well. I have a feeling replacing these with ceramic or glass skates will make the mouse feel even more premium like my RAT8+. Overall the performance in games for me gets a 4/5 because the weights do not go low enough to get a true lightweight experience on the mouse.The build quality is a 5/5 though and the looks are an easy 4/5 or 5/5 depending on taste, if you like the looks anyways.  I like RGB and you can turn it off. It does look a little basic without RGB, so that might be a 3/5. Armory crate is a mixed bag of an experience I am seeing, truly. I would not let the Armory crate dissuade anyone from getting this, unless they have a known interfering software like in some cases MSI Center and/or Corsair iCue."}

Luckily most of the buttons near there I've just mapped to pause and play videos so it's not that big of a downside.I've had to get used to this new style of gripping the mouse. It did cause my hand some slight pain and discomfort initially. But having used it for close to a month now I've gotten used to it and my hand feels comfortable with it now.PROS:- USB C (my previous corsair mouse had micro USB so having USB C is definitely an upgrade as well as having it charge while plugged in.)- Magnetic Charging stand (Feels great not having to plug my mouse into any wires and just having it snap to the magnetic stand is satisfying. I put my charging stand flat on my table since it's easier to remove the mouse without moving the stand that way.)- Battery life (I had it running for quite a few days before its battery got low. compared to my corsair one which usually lasted around a day. You can also configure the app to let the mouse's lights start flashing whenever the battery gets low to notify you.)CONS:- Large/shape might feel awkward to use at first (Gets better as time goes on but ultimately this will be dependent on the person that uses it)- Side buttons might feel like they are in an awkward spot when trying to lift the mouse which can lead to accidental button presses."}

It takes a long time to load even on high end systems and seems to crash 20% of the time or has to constantly reload.  The Software will refuse to allow you to change settings if you haven't updated everything included.  The mouse itself is great and of good build quality.  It's for bigger hands so if you have average or small hands using the joystick on the side is a bit difficult.  Some reviewers state you can't switch profiles without the Armoury Crate software but that's incorrect.  The manual has a brief rundown of how to save profiles, with the software installed, and then switch profiles when the software is not installed, which you'll probably need to do as having the software is such a pain.  You can assign the joystick to be either an analog stick like a controller or have it act as a 4 way hat with different functions assigned to each direction(media keys KB buttons etc.)  The four side buttons are placed a little awkwardly and I have a feeling they should have been stacked more closely together for comfort but they are acceptable and not awful.  Scroll wheel feels nice and apparently has it's own color scheme in the LED options.  And boy this thing has lots of preset and customizable lighting effects.  One of the main if not the main draw for me on this mouse is the replaceable mouse switches.  You get two sets in the box, one set installed and another type that I haven't tried yet but are said to be of a different feel and connection type.  More mice need to do this.  This would resolve every double clicking issue if you could just easily replace switches to repair the mouse.  DPI switch made very easy by the buttons on the bottom and with the software installed will tell you which profile you are on through window notification.  All in all a really good customizable mouse with tons of features.  The software works but is so slow or at times crash prone that this is the only real downfall of the product.  Asus seriously needs to optimize this software, it feels as if it's a webpage loading and i'm on mid 90s internet at times.  Good buy but that software just makes it far from perfect to set up profiles.  I will say once you have everything and every one of your profiles set you can then delete the software and switch with mouse button combos on the fly."}

The mouse itself is well-engineered and is built to be repaired. The side buttons are a little poorly laid out, but it is mostly just a matter of getting used to them.The poor score comes with the necessary software. ROG Armoury crate. That is the software needed to interface with the mouse. The mouse, of course, defaults to some insane rainbow pulse setting that is super distracting and whatever clown decided on the functions on the side buttons needs to be fired. At no time, have I EVER, needed a side button on my mouse to serve as a windows key.Easy fix though, right? You install the software, and you can just swap the side buttons over to standard mouse 4,5,6 etc and change the colors to something more appealing.Here is what then goes wrong:1) Armoury crate hangs on install. This is a well documented issue going back years. Some systems have to locate a full copy of the software and install that instead of being able to use the download that asus provides on the mouse driver list.2) Armoury crate isn't just for controlling your mouse. It is some insane nexus of software that will also attempt to control the RGB lighting for any asus products you have. Also it will try to gain control over your motherboard fans.3) Armoury crate will run no less than five processes on your system and will, at idle, consume approximately five percent of your CPU. You can't shut them off in the software, even if you have no other asus products to control.4) The armoury crate software will only sometimes detect that your mouse exists.5) The side buttons you wanted to reassign to mouse 4, 5, 6? You CAN'T. THAT ISN'T AN OPTION. Your only option is to reassign them to keyboard keys or some other multimedia mess.Hokay though. You've gotten through it. You've scraped together some lighting system that isn't awful and reassigned the keys to they are at least not annoying. The mouse itself? Great! It has on-board memory, so it remembers the profile you put on it and doesn't need the software to remain on the computer. So you uninstall armoury crate. EXCEPT NOPE. The uninstaller doesn't actually uninstall the software. It only uninstalls SOME of the services running. NOW you have to track down the uninstall tool, which still leaves files on the machine, but at least it seems to have uninstalled the services.In short, the mouse is great, but the necessary software is so bad that it is literally a criminal violation in many US states."}

I have tried downloading everything they suggest. However, the main program for setting the buttons' uses won't even start on my computer. This ruins anything good about the mouse by making it useless. Also, the thumb rest is also of no use given the size of the buttons.

The charging stand is an awesome idea and it looks great on your desk with great battery indicators.The thing that made me return this mouse though was because after about two days of normal use the software to program the buttons, Armoury Crate, stopped recognizing the mouse. I would click on the mouse under the connected devices and the screen would either go black or give me the error message in the image I included here. I troubleshooted this for about 5 hours or more. I reinstalled the software, made sure drivers were up to date, made sure all services for the mouse were running in MSConfig, reconnected the mouse physically and via the wireless connection, and a whole slew of other things. It would still work like a normal mouse but I could not use the software to program the buttons. I tried to look up the problem and I found some promising posts on the Asus forum but for some reason I could not get my Asus account to create a forum account. I put in a ticket with Asus to fix this and they never responded. I also tried to contact their general product support. Their chat feature was completely unresponsive and when I sent an email I got no response after three days. I even tweeted at them and they did not respond. It was way too much effort for this so I returned the mouse and went back to a G604. I thought Logitech's software was bad but compared to ASUS they're top notch. At least Logitech responded to me and was able to resolve my issues."}

It makes meleeing in games so much easier, and the side buttons allow for quickly throwing grenades and sliding around the map a since in Fps games. But the draw backs still exist, the center button on the side needs to be just a bit bigger not because it's hard to press but because sometimes u hit the button closest to it instead, and in battle pressing the wrong button can get u killed, the buttons next to the left click also needs to be moved down slightly down more to be easier to access or shortened a bit they are unnessicarly long for some reason. And they need to add an infinite scroll button.Pros-lots of buttons-battery life is amazing (1-2 charges a week)-if u have a big hand like mine it's a perfect fit-no perceived latency when wireless-sturdy-replaceable switchesCons-no infinite scroll-center button on side could be just smidgen bigger-index finger buttons could be adjusted too be easier to press when using side buttons-if u have small hands don't get this mouse"}

One of the really nice things i Like about the mouse is the fact ASUS includes 2 extra switches, which i unfortunately had to use.Here is the one \"rub\" of this mouse.  Apparently, my pointer and middle fingers gravitate towards the center of the mouse.  That would not be an issue, except the clicks get \"stuck\" from time to time, and i just have to click in the middle of the button to release it.  Not a big deal on MMO/local FPS gaming, but can be frustrating at times.  I hope ASUS is reading this and figures a way to resolve this issue, because i really like the mouse, especially with the investment i made in the mouse, i would love for it to work wherever I click on the button."}

Aside from that, if you have longer hands, longer fingers, this mouse would work fine for you, from base measurement of my hand is 19cm from middle finger to wrist or a little over 7 3/4\" for the americans; added i also hold my mouse in a more similar style of claw grip.

I have already updated to the latest firmware and the problem persists.

It is still going strong. The optical switches are still the most reliable and responsive switches I have ever used. Even after millions of clicks and hardcore daily usage, this thing is as reliable as the day I got it. I can count on it to make clicks exactly when I intended to, never double clicking and never false triggering. Gamers know just how important this is.Battery still easily lasts for 2 days with constant usage and RGB brightness at the default 30%. Aside from the textures on the sidegrips having been worn completely smooth where the tip of my thumb rests and some discoloration of the skates, you practically cannot tell that this mouse has ever been used.I did run into a bit of trouble with the middle click requiring harder presses to register at one point. However, all I had to do was bang the mouse a couple times on the side against my mousepad and blow on the scroll wheel with pressurized air, and it has been working normally again ever since. Truly, nothing can faze this mouse.Of course, I should address that during those 2 years, Razer has updated the Viper series. To put it bluntly, the Viper V2 Pro is not worth it at all unless you value a 16g lighter weight over absolutely everything, on a mouse that is already extremely light. The V2 Pro lacks tons of features including side buttons on both sides, docked charging, and RGB. It also has a smaller battery. With this original Razer Viper Ultimate practically being permanently on sale now (being a \"previous generation\" mouse), it just has too much value over the new Viper V2 Pro, making the decision a no-brainer.In 2023, this is still the greatest mouse I have ever used, hands down. I still find it extremely comfortable in my hands. And there is no greater feeling than to know that I can always rely on this mouse to do exactly what I want it to do, 100% of the time.Razer, you'll have to do WAY better than the Viper V2 Pro to beat this Viper Ultimate.(P.S., Synapse is still terrible. It has no problems switching profiles anymore, but now it will occasionally go crazy with the CPU usage.)_____________________________________________Original Review:To preface - I find it very difficult to find a mouse shape that is comfortable for me.  My hands are roughly 19x10 cm and I use a full palm grip. My favorite mouse in terms of comfort is the Corsair Nightsword, followed by the Corsair M65. I also owned the Razer Basilisk, which is comfortable at first, but starts to cramp my hand with extended use.I have long been searching for a proper wireless mouse with a good RELIABLE connection, rechargeability/good battery life, a reasonable price, and of course above all, a good shape. It's no secret that the Viper Ultimate and the G Pro Wireless have been hailed as the best wireless mice around, but the price always kept me away from giving them a shot. Plus, I had heard about double click issues with the G Pro and the shape looked too ambidextrous for me. The more contoured shape of the Viper Ultimate and its optical switches caught my eye more. So when Prime Day came around and I saw the mouse + dock combo at $89.99, I jumped at the opportunity. (I would definitely not recommend paying $150 or even $120 for any mouse, it just isn't worth it.)Shape: 9/10I was scared of this the most since very few mice are comfortable to me. But when I started using the mouse, it felt great, to my surprise. Sure, the hump is a lower than I would have preferred, but my hand can rest very naturally on it with no cramping or fatigue. The low profile and relative lack of contours on the side make it slightly hard to pick up without it feeling like it's slipping out of your hand, but the incredibly light weight certainly makes up for it a bit. I didn't give it a 10/10 because for me, it still isn't as comfortable as the Corsair Nightsword (which feels like it was practically molded for my hand). Overall though, very comfortable and I plan to use it as my main mouse.Buttons: 9/10The main buttons are a 10/10 for me (Left click, Right click, and Scroll Wheel/Middle Click). They feel crisp and snappy with just enough feedback. I can definitely notice the optical switches. Every click feels EXTREMELY fast and responsive, but not in an oversensitive type of way. I use a mechanical keyboard with optical switches, and that has held up very well with 0 misfires or double-presses, so I am hoping for the same from this mouse. Every one of my mice with standard mechanical switches has ended up double clicking after some time and having to get replaced. My only problem with this mouse's buttons are the side buttons. They are way too recessed in the mouse (almost flush with the body) and I would definitely prefer them to stick out a bit more. Aside from that the buttons are very well built, with 0 wobble and a nice click.Software: 3/10Sorry Razer, but synapse just sucks. (Take some notes from Corsair please).The profile switching for recognizing different programs is extremely slow, causes the mouse to freeze up for a few seconds, and can even \"crash\" the mouse and require it to be turned on and off again. Apparently some other uses said this is because Synapse literally uploads the new profile to the mouse every time you switch programs, which is a terrible design. There IS a workaround, made possible by the fact that this mouse has on-board storage. Store the profiles you are using on the mouse's on-board storage, and you can use it without a hitch. However, this is really no excuse for Synapse to suck as there are plenty of other Razer mice that do not have on-board storage.The other big problem with Synapse is that macros do not immediately stop after you release a button - they will continue playing to completion. This severely limits the number of applications where you would choose to use a macro as this makes it too unsafe to use in many situations.Wireless: 10/10 (With the workaround stated above)Great connectivity - extremely reliable and responsive, as long as you use the workaround for Synapse. Switching profiles without the workaround was the only time the mouse would ever hiccup/disconnect. With the work around, it is just as reliable as a wired connection. And when the mouse goes into \"sleep\" mode, I hardly notice a delay when I wake it up.Sensor: 10/10Great sensor, combined with the low weight and low-friction gliding feet the tracking is silky smooth. Lift off distance is extremely low as well and can be further adjusted in Synapse.Weight: 10/10Extremely light. Do I sometimes miss having a sniper button to lower my DPI? Sure. But do I need it with such a light mouse? Certainly not. Any small micro-movements are extremely easy to make and it requires little to no-effort to move this mouse.Battery Life: 10/10I've been using this mouse with the default setting of 33% RGB brightness, and when I'm actively using the mouse at the computer for the whole day (12+ hours), it barely goes down to 70%. For less intensive use, you might last a whole 5 days without charging, or even a whole week. If you turn off the RGB, you could go for even longer._____________________________________________Final remarks:While the shape doesn't quite reach the 10/10 comfort that the Corsair Nightsword is for me, it is still extremely comfortable at a 9/10. Had I not experienced the Nightsword, I might have rated this a 10/10. It is comfortable enough that, combined with being wireless and having optical switches, I am completely sold on it. It is now my new primary mouse.The buttons are great, and I have high hopes for the reliability of the optical switches as Razer is the mouse maker currently using them. Wireless connectivity and and battery life are amazing. Synapse is the only thing that sucks. Razer please fix the software - it's borderline a dealbreaker that makes me reluctant to ever consider Razer products. If you ever see this mouse on sale, I highly recommend it. Just don't ever pay more than $100 for a mouse unless it was signed by Bob Ross."}

This is hands down the best Razer mouse I've used so far and possibly the best mouse I've used as well.  I haven't been on the bandwagon for lighter and lighter weight mice.  Now I might have to jump on that train because the Viper Ultimate is so shockingly light I have a hard time believing that it still works.  Previously I had the Razer Taipan and perceptually it's about 2.5 times heavier.  The transition over has taken a bit of time to get used to but I do like it.  It does feel like you can rapidly change the direction the mouse is moving without much effort and it could lead to better performance playing shooters in particular.Both the Taipan and the Viper Ultimate have rubber grips on the sides of the mouse, and I think It's a really nice feature of both.  I've used wireless mice in the past, a Microsoft one that failed me several times in the heat of battle that used AAA batteries.  I was really unsure about using a wireless mouse again but I figured it was about time to try one again, possibly the technology has improved over the years and certainly it has.  I was tempted by the Razer Orochi v2 but I didn't want to be buying batteries over and over.  I think the Viper Ultimate is a bit better for my personal preferences and I really do like it.  I was watching some YouTube videos analyzing the latency differences between current wireless mice and wired mice.  For the first time I think wireless mice are so competitive with wired mice its there is no major reason to be using a wired mouse outside of cost.  The Razer Viper Ultimate is a great example of this.  There may be a valid argument that the Viper 8k has superior performance over the Viper Ultimate Wireless but the mice refresh rate is so far above what most monitors can display at 1000Hz pooling rate It doesn't feel like there is a major reason to be concerned about it.  Not only that but I've heard the processing required to keep track of the cursor at 8000Hz actually drops your in game frame rate by about 3-4 frames per second (depending on your hardware configuration of course).  I don't see the benefit of a 8000Hz pooling rate right now.  In the end I think it's a great time to transition to a wireless mouse if your interested in it and are able to afford it.I purchased the version of the Viper Ultimate which included the dock and I'm glad I did.  The dock has a magnet on it which makes far easier to rest the mouse on the dock in the correct position for it to charge and you really just don't have to think about dropping the mouse on the dock, the convenience is great.  My only complaint about the dock is that it's so light that sometimes I pull up on the mouse and the dock actually lifts off my desk because the magnet is strong enough to carry the weight of the dock for a few seconds before it drops.  I guess the engineers of the mouse decided to add a sticky pad on the bottom of the dock to help with this but I think this is a lame solution.  A weighted dock design would be far superior in my opinion and hopefully it will be included in a future release.  I don't like the thought of a sticky pad on my desk, it might make a gross sticky mess (which thankfully it hasn't) and possibly will become a hard dusty mass in a few years time anyway.  That's really my biggest complaint with the mouse/dock combo.A minor issue I have with the mouse itself is the Teflon feet.  I wish there was a larger Teflon pad at the back end of the mouse, or maybe two separate feet that are larger that covers that back end area a bit better.  In the past I've used mice for years and years on end before replacing them and the back end of the mouse get's the most feet pad wear (at least for me).  I feel like the Viper Ultimate may not last as long just because the back end feet are not significant enough and they are positioned far to the sides of the mouse, to the point I'll be lifting the mouse up off the mousepad surface and then setting it down, back down back end first and dragging the plastic of the mouse on the plastic mousepad surface for a few moments before the Teflon feet make contact with the mousepad.  This is not ideal in my opinion.Razer synapse, I personally don't mind running software in the background for peripherals as long as it doesn't take up too many system resources and Synapse doesn't.  I HATE the way one has to log into an account to make use of some of the features.  No mouse should require one to create an account to make full use of a mouse, that is a garbage idea for user convenience.  I personally think convenience should be prioritized over most aspects of a products design and this causes me anger every time the synapse software asks me for the password that I usually have forgotten in the weeks that go by where I don't have to enter the password.  Even if I tell it to remember my password the Synapse software still asks me for my password from time to time (I think when it does an update).  It's difficult for me to put into words how rage inducing this is, mostly because it feels so unnecessary.  The software should remember your password no matter what, #1 and #2 you should not need to create an account to make use of mouse software, It's trash on two fronts.  Okay, Razer is a business and they feel like they require minor tracking of their customer base so they can make better business decisions and satisfy customers.  I don't like it at all but hypothetically I can understand.  Message to Razer: Make the Synapse software remember your log in info no matter what.  This software design is just as important as your hardware design work.  For over half of the use of my Razer Taipan I didn't use Synapse at all because it was such a pain in the rear end to make sure I'm logged in all the time.  This may indeed only be an issue with the older version of Synapse, so far I haven't had this issue since purchasing the Viper Ultimate.  I really hope Razer has resolved this and I no longer will be plagued with login requests.In the end very few products are perfect and it is hard to fault the Viper Ultimate Wireless with very much.  I think it's a product worth buying and I'm glad I purchased it, I hope it will last me a few years and be a valuable part of my gaming hardware arsenal.  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing this mouse, I wouldn't hesitate too much, its pretty awesome overall.  It is a bit more pricy compared to some wired options but I do prefer wireless over a corded mouse even with a cord bungie (which are really great by the way).  Definitely consider the Viper Ultimate Wireless mouse if your in the market for a mouse, It's a great option in my opinion, despite my complaints."}

From keypads, to keyboards, and now mice as well. The Viper Ultimate is Razer’s one-two punch answer to the Logitech G Pro wireless, which is now getting on over a year old, and it is quite the response. Featuring an incredibly comfortable and sleek ambidextrous design, the Viper Ultimate stands tall amongst its peers, offering one of the best gaming experiences you can have with a mouse.Razer designed the original wired Viper with a key feature set in mind – creating a light, fast, wickedly responsive and premium gaming mouse and the Viper Ultimate adds to that with the addition of wireless connectivity. Long gone are the days of wireless mice being shunned by gamers and only being reserved for travel or general purpose use, wireless mice now stand at the forefront of gaming with offerings from Razer, Corsair, Logitech, Steelseries and other major manufacturers as upgrades to their wired siblings.The Viper and Viper Ultimate offer an extremely comfortable shape and design that really shows how far Razer has come with their mouse design. Subtle comfort grooves in the buttons, crisp button presses, well-stepped mouse wheel, and extremely comfortable rubber sides really make the mouse feel premium. The Viper is ideal for medium to medium-large hands, offering comfortable grip options for both palm, claw, and hybrid grip styles. Fingertip grip is possible here, but not recommended as the mouse as a longer body that is not well suited to fingertip grip styles. Integrated firm rubber sides, textured matte plastic body, and super comfortable shape for left and right handed users really take the spotlight. The mouse has side buttons on both sides, but are cleverly designed so that you never have to worry about accidental presses on either side, and even if you are worried about still somehow hitting the side buttons on the opposite side of the mouse – it is a simple enough task to go into the software and disable them. The mouse is also extremely rigid and sturdy, having no flex or bowing at all, there is a slight rattle but I think it is either in the mouse wheel or lens of the sensor. Not sure though, but it is nothing to be worried about, pretty standard fare there, though I would like to see that eliminated in the future., Lighting is minimal, with the only RGB goodness being the classic Razer logo on the butt of the mouse being lit up, but the charging stand also has an RGB LED on its base and integrates seamlessly into the Razer Chroma ecosystem and works as expected.Ultra low latency, long battery life, and ditching the cable drag are great bullet points for any wireless mouse manufacturer to have – but only a few have managed to add “under 100g” to that list. Logitech launched their G Pro wireless last year with a surprising 78g weight that was lighter than most wired mice, and now that smaller, lighter mice are in – it was the perfect time for Razer to fire back. The Viper Ultimate weighs in at a shockingly light and nimble 74g (2.6 ounces), beating out everything but the Glorious Model O series, the Finalmouse UItralight 2, and the Coolermaster MM710. And at 74g, I would gladly give up my Finalmouse’s ultra-feathery light weight for a better shape and wireless capabilities. I’d also be shocked if we didn’t see an even lighter Viper out next year with the ever popular honey comb design and even lighter materials, I’m almost positive that they could get the weight below 50g with relative ease.So we have a masterful recipe for success here with a great weight and balance, wireless connectivity, and sleek design and shape, but what about the internals?I am glad to say that the inside of the Viper and Viper Ultimate are just as well designed as the outside. The sensor is the result of the partnership between PixArt and Razer, and what they’ve brought with the 3399 is an incredibly fast, accurate, top-of-the line optical sensor that is near flawless in its execution. While the reported resolution of the sensor goes up to a true 20,000 cpi – we all know that none of us will ever even come close to using that level of granularity given that the overwhelming majority of gamers use 2000 dpi or lower. But it is nice to know that the option is there – in the event that we have 20K displays. The bottom is equipped with pure 100% PTFE feet without any dye positioned at the corners of the mouse and around the sensor itself. The absence of the black dye means there is zero grittiness to the glide of the mouse when moving it, and rivals that of aftermarket mouse feet like Hyperglides. The only reason you’ll ever need to replace these feet is if they ever wear out, they’re as good as mouse feet get. The clicks are satisfying and tactile, offering an instant response due to their opto-electric nature. Speaking of which, the opto-electric switches are great! Because there are no actual contacts, the switches have an incredibly long lifespan, over 50 million clicks and are immune to double-clicking that their mechanical microswitch brethren are notorious for.Included with the mouse is a charging dock that functions both as a home for the wireless receiver if you so choose and as a convenient and fast way to charge the mouse when not in use. Simply plop the mouse on the dock when you walk away to get a drink or go to bed, it is as simple as that – not that you’ll need to do that very often. The Viper Ultimate sports a staggeringly impressive maximum battery life of 70+ hours on one charge, and can be charged from 0-80% in 90 minutes or less. The cable used to plug into the charging dock can be used to connect the mouse directly to the computer to be used in a wired state, if you for some reason should want to do that. It is very lightweight and flexible, only ever so slightly stiffer than the Viper wired cable. Let’s be real here though, if you’re buying a wireless mouse only to plug it in and use it wired, what are you doing?At $150, it might be a tough purchase for some – but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it. If you are looking for the absolute best wireless gaming mouse out there right now, the Viper Ultimate is it. There is little room for debate on whether or not the Viper Ultimate is the king of gaming mice in 2019. Ultimately though, the best mouse for you is the one that feels best in your hand. So many mice have top optical sensors and similar specs, that it comes down to personal preference in regards to the shape. For me, the Viper Ultimate shape fits my hands extraordinarily well, whereas the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 and Logitech G Pro wireless exist at opposite ends of comfort for me. The Ultralight 2 is too small for my hands, and the G Pro feels too much like a semi-circular plastic dome, but the Viper Ultimate is just right.If there’s anything I would consider changing it would be creating a honey-comb shell design that would further reduce the weight and possibly making the side buttons modular, similar to that of Logitech’s offerings so that if we so choose to could simply remove the side buttons for the side of the mouse that we are not using.Razer, 2019 is the year you came back hard. I love what you’re offering and I really hope 2020 brings as much if not more innovation to your future product lines. You guys are champions, once more."}

The switches are pretty much the entire reason I bought this mouse over other mice. I'M SO SICK OF THE DOUBLE CLICK ISSUE AND I'M PRAYING THIS FIXES IT. Happened to my original Naga, kept me from buying another Razer mouse but then it happened even worse to my Zowie EC2-A. They are about the same \"speed\" as normal switches. Latency isn't better or worse. You can test this online.+ This is my first wireless mouse and I'm pleased to say that wireless feels just as responsive  as wired mode. VERY nice to not have to deal with a wire anymore and not have any downsides.+ Good customization within Synapse such as button programming, lighting, power-saving mode threshold, custom DPI, lift-off distance, etc.+ Saving to onboard memory is great, as is having the option to log in to synapse as Guest.+ Different methods of using and charging the mouse is really nice.+ Feet are good. No issues and glide nicely on a QCK Heavy. Texture on the shell is good and grippy. I prefer this textured plastic over a rubber coating. Rubber sides feel good. Grippy and not mushy at all. Mouse wheel has good feedback and feels good to scroll (for now) and has a nice grippy texture. Side buttons and scroll wheel feel pretty good to click and the NORMAL ones aren't in the way (left side for right-handed, right side for left-handed). There's no play/travel distance on the side buttons like there is on some mice like my old EC2-A.+ Battery life seems good. Going to actually test it now on full charge with lighting off but so far it seems as-advertised, at least for the most part.- After leaving it charging all night through the direct connection and from maybe around 20%, Synapse only read a 97% charge. I restarted Synapse to see if it was reading wrong but it still read 97%. I placed it on the dock for a few minutes and it fully charged to 100%. Not sure what that's about but thought I'd mention it. Will test this more.- Unsure if it's just Windows 7 not playing nice with it, but when switching modes, the mouse sometimes doesn't allow me to interact with things outside of my online browser. For example,  I'll switch from wired to wireless mode and I'll be able to move my cursor and interact with my  browser but NOTHING else is interactable until I restart the Windows explorer process. I can't highlight icons, close or open programs, windows or anything. Very strange and really hope this won't be an ongoing issue.- Could be an issue on my end but Synapse doesn't recognize the mouse or dock on either of my USB 3.0 ports. ONLY when I use the wireless receiver by itself does it recognize the mouse in Synapse. If the receiver is in the dock or even if the wire is connected directly to the mouse, Synapse will not pick it up. I still have function but can't change any settings until I use a USB 2 port. Ports work fine with other hardware.- Just a few days in and, though still good, the mouse wheel has slightly lost some of it's  snappiness in it's scroll and the left and right clicks have developed a slight give. Somewhat  nitpicking here, but I would really hate it if the mouse felt like crap to use in just a few months.  For the price, this things should be rock solid for years and not develop that mushy cheapness.- Didn't think I would, but I constantly press the sidebuttons on the right side when I'm aiming (I use it in my right hand). I had to disable them through Synapse. Thankfully you can and then save the setting to internal  memory. Unfortunately, I can't use them now for other things if I wanted to, such as  volume control.- Some part of the Razer software (Razer Synapse Service Process) stays running even after you select \"Exit All Apps\" from the  tray icon. This happened with my old Razer Naga too. Normally, I wouldn't care THAT much, but this particular process KILLS fps in my games. I literally have to end the process or games stutter like crazy for some reason, or at least Overwatch does.- Really just personal opinion, but it'd be nice if Razer would make some smaller mice. Pretty much all of their mice are too big in one way or another for someone with smaller hands and depending on how you grip. This one is just a bit too long for me personally.Overall, I think if it lasts and the shell doesn't become mushy and creaky like it very well may with enough use, it's everything a competitive FPS player would ever need IF (big if) the mouse fits your hand well. Measure your hands and decide for yourself. Mine are roughly...H 7.25 inches x W 4.25 inches (H 18.415 cm x W 10.795 cm)3 finger width (index, middle, ring) =  2.125 inches (5.3975 cm)Middle finger + knuckle = 4 1/4 inches (10.795 cm)And I probably fall somewhere between claw and fingertip grip, probably leaning more towards fingertip.--------------------------------------------So far, for me, after less than one week with the mouse:Performance: 10/10Comfort: 6.5/10 (subjective and also still getting used to the shape so likely to go up, but hitting sidebuttons accidentally sucks - also my first ambidextrous)Feedback: 8.5/10 (this will get lower if the shell quality doesn't hold and the snappiness diminishes)Quality: 8/10 (mostly concerned about long-term quality here as left/right buttons already have some slight give/shake to them after a few days of use and the scroll doesn't feel like it's going to hold it's feeling of precision and snappiness in it's steps - otherwise though, pretty solid)Software: 7/10 (good options but a little too bloated - can thankfully choose which software you'd like to install)Value: 7/10 (I got it on sale for $120 but I think it's worth more around $100 - if it was perfect for my hand and grip, $120 would be kind of okay maybe, however twice the price of the wired is high enough - full price is simply too much and in the end, I might come to regret not just buying two $60 mice and a bungee)Currently, this mouse is hovering around an 8 or 8.5/10 for me. This is likely to go up to a 9 with use and as I get used to it's size and shape, just as long as quality and performance stays the same as it is now. Overall I commend Razer for innovating and listening to it's customers and I hope to enjoy this mouse with no issue for years to come."}

That should say how much I use my mouse, not counting how rough I am on my mice, such as when sliding & lifting them across my mouse-pad or the occasional accidental drop. This lead me to typically only buy Razer mice, because all of the other main brand mice usually break around the 5 month mark for me.This is not to mention my original Razer Deathadder V1 mouse lasted 7 years of VERY harsh daily use, and only failed because its scroll-wheel broke. (Abbreviating Deathadder to DA from now on)That's not to say I haven't had issues with Razer products, my first DA V2 lasted 1 week until both the left click and the scroll wheel started failing leading me to then use the other brand name mice; G502 Hero lasted 5 months, Corsair M55 lasted 2 weeks,and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste lasted 3 months.My next Razer product was a DA V2 pro and that one lasted 2 years, Which led me to buy this one after that one started not sensing right clicks.Issues:I had zero issues with it for 8 months, then, entirely out of random, started having weird issues with connectivity.  This started out with very minuscule connectivity issues, such as it waiting 30 seconds for my PC and Razer's software to start working properly to use the mouse when it gets turned on after being off for a while.This was annoying, but I didn't care too much about that since I could still do whatever I needed to do.But fast forward ~4 months and the issues have compounded a little bit and I get my connection cut off when playing games for a solid 4 seconds at a time, and at this point this is getting REALLY annoying to endure (This happens plugged in too).At this point I am also having issues with the mouse having a slowed reception & it being able to hold a charge for more than half a day. I used to be able to use it at it's highest pulling rate and low brightness of the LED for 5 days without charging.Positives:Very durable plastic, I have very little wear on the mouse besides a bit of wear on the left click plastic making it shiny instead of matte black.Very comfortable if you claw grip your mouse (Not comfortable if you palm the entire mouse).Very light and easy to move on a mouse-pad.Fairly priced, ~$60 is quite decent for this mouse.Lasted 10 Months until having some bigger issues (Most mice completely break around the 5th month for me).Scroll wheel is perfect, zero squeaking (like a Corsair M55) or aggressive rumble feeling (like a Logitech G502) and has a good rubberized texture to it (HyperX Pulsefire haste didn't have any great texturing).Great for putting into a schoolbag for college or for storing in a laptop case.Buttons and sensor are great and feel immaculate.Cons:Either the USB dongle, or the mouse itself is having issues cutting out and not working at random after close to a year of use. The same with sensitivity, it has definitely gone down for the sensor.Battery is now starting to have issues holding a charge.This is where I am currently at with this mouse, It has worked very well for what it is, but I may soon have to upgrade, due to the issues I am having.You will probably have a longer service life on your mouse though, especially if you are not rough on your electronics.I would 100% recommend this if you need it for a laptop and need it to be wireless, or have smaller hands that are not as fitting for a Razer Deathadder."}

If you play a song that some guy hit the bass drum once, the cursor is moving on you. I've been playing FPS games all of my life, but I can't get the flick down for this mouse; the lack of weight gives 0 feedback to your hand. You are basically reactionary to everything. By that, I mean move the mouse first, react to how the screen moves, then adjust accordingly.

It is still going strong. The optical switches are still the most reliable and responsive switches I have ever used. Even after millions of clicks and hardcore daily usage, this thing is as reliable as the day I got it. I can count on it to make clicks exactly when I intended to, never double clicking and never false triggering. Gamers know just how important this is.Battery still easily lasts for 2 days with constant usage and RGB brightness at the default 30%. Aside from the textures on the sidegrips having been worn completely smooth where the tip of my thumb rests and some discoloration of the skates, you practically cannot tell that this mouse has ever been used.I did run into a bit of trouble with the middle click requiring harder presses to register at one point. However, all I had to do was bang the mouse a couple times on the side against my mousepad and blow on the scroll wheel with pressurized air, and it has been working normally again ever since. Truly, nothing can faze this mouse.Of course, I should address that during those 2 years, Razer has updated the Viper series. To put it bluntly, the Viper V2 Pro is not worth it at all unless you value a 16g lighter weight over absolutely everything, on a mouse that is already extremely light. The V2 Pro lacks tons of features including side buttons on both sides, docked charging, and RGB. It also has a smaller battery. With this original Razer Viper Ultimate practically being permanently on sale now (being a \"previous generation\" mouse), it just has too much value over the new Viper V2 Pro, making the decision a no-brainer.In 2023, this is still the greatest mouse I have ever used, hands down. I still find it extremely comfortable in my hands. And there is no greater feeling than to know that I can always rely on this mouse to do exactly what I want it to do, 100% of the time.Razer, you'll have to do WAY better than the Viper V2 Pro to beat this Viper Ultimate.(P.S., Synapse is still terrible. It has no problems switching profiles anymore, but now it will occasionally go crazy with the CPU usage.)_____________________________________________Original Review:To preface - I find it very difficult to find a mouse shape that is comfortable for me.  My hands are roughly 19x10 cm and I use a full palm grip. My favorite mouse in terms of comfort is the Corsair Nightsword, followed by the Corsair M65. I also owned the Razer Basilisk, which is comfortable at first, but starts to cramp my hand with extended use.I have long been searching for a proper wireless mouse with a good RELIABLE connection, rechargeability/good battery life, a reasonable price, and of course above all, a good shape. It's no secret that the Viper Ultimate and the G Pro Wireless have been hailed as the best wireless mice around, but the price always kept me away from giving them a shot. Plus, I had heard about double click issues with the G Pro and the shape looked too ambidextrous for me. The more contoured shape of the Viper Ultimate and its optical switches caught my eye more. So when Prime Day came around and I saw the mouse + dock combo at $89.99, I jumped at the opportunity. (I would definitely not recommend paying $150 or even $120 for any mouse, it just isn't worth it.)Shape: 9/10I was scared of this the most since very few mice are comfortable to me. But when I started using the mouse, it felt great, to my surprise. Sure, the hump is a lower than I would have preferred, but my hand can rest very naturally on it with no cramping or fatigue. The low profile and relative lack of contours on the side make it slightly hard to pick up without it feeling like it's slipping out of your hand, but the incredibly light weight certainly makes up for it a bit. I didn't give it a 10/10 because for me, it still isn't as comfortable as the Corsair Nightsword (which feels like it was practically molded for my hand). Overall though, very comfortable and I plan to use it as my main mouse.Buttons: 9/10The main buttons are a 10/10 for me (Left click, Right click, and Scroll Wheel/Middle Click). They feel crisp and snappy with just enough feedback. I can definitely notice the optical switches. Every click feels EXTREMELY fast and responsive, but not in an oversensitive type of way. I use a mechanical keyboard with optical switches, and that has held up very well with 0 misfires or double-presses, so I am hoping for the same from this mouse. Every one of my mice with standard mechanical switches has ended up double clicking after some time and having to get replaced. My only problem with this mouse's buttons are the side buttons. They are way too recessed in the mouse (almost flush with the body) and I would definitely prefer them to stick out a bit more. Aside from that the buttons are very well built, with 0 wobble and a nice click.Software: 3/10Sorry Razer, but synapse just sucks. (Take some notes from Corsair please).The profile switching for recognizing different programs is extremely slow, causes the mouse to freeze up for a few seconds, and can even \"crash\" the mouse and require it to be turned on and off again. Apparently some other uses said this is because Synapse literally uploads the new profile to the mouse every time you switch programs, which is a terrible design. There IS a workaround, made possible by the fact that this mouse has on-board storage. Store the profiles you are using on the mouse's on-board storage, and you can use it without a hitch. However, this is really no excuse for Synapse to suck as there are plenty of other Razer mice that do not have on-board storage.The other big problem with Synapse is that macros do not immediately stop after you release a button - they will continue playing to completion. This severely limits the number of applications where you would choose to use a macro as this makes it too unsafe to use in many situations.Wireless: 10/10 (With the workaround stated above)Great connectivity - extremely reliable and responsive, as long as you use the workaround for Synapse. Switching profiles without the workaround was the only time the mouse would ever hiccup/disconnect. With the work around, it is just as reliable as a wired connection. And when the mouse goes into \"sleep\" mode, I hardly notice a delay when I wake it up.Sensor: 10/10Great sensor, combined with the low weight and low-friction gliding feet the tracking is silky smooth. Lift off distance is extremely low as well and can be further adjusted in Synapse.Weight: 10/10Extremely light. Do I sometimes miss having a sniper button to lower my DPI? Sure. But do I need it with such a light mouse? Certainly not. Any small micro-movements are extremely easy to make and it requires little to no-effort to move this mouse.Battery Life: 10/10I've been using this mouse with the default setting of 33% RGB brightness, and when I'm actively using the mouse at the computer for the whole day (12+ hours), it barely goes down to 70%. For less intensive use, you might last a whole 5 days without charging, or even a whole week. If you turn off the RGB, you could go for even longer._____________________________________________Final remarks:While the shape doesn't quite reach the 10/10 comfort that the Corsair Nightsword is for me, it is still extremely comfortable at a 9/10. Had I not experienced the Nightsword, I might have rated this a 10/10. It is comfortable enough that, combined with being wireless and having optical switches, I am completely sold on it. It is now my new primary mouse.The buttons are great, and I have high hopes for the reliability of the optical switches as Razer is the mouse maker currently using them. Wireless connectivity and and battery life are amazing. Synapse is the only thing that sucks. Razer please fix the software - it's borderline a dealbreaker that makes me reluctant to ever consider Razer products. If you ever see this mouse on sale, I highly recommend it. Just don't ever pay more than $100 for a mouse unless it was signed by Bob Ross."}

Previously I had the Razer Taipan and perceptually it's about 2.5 times heavier.  The transition over has taken a bit of time to get used to but I do like it.  It does feel like you can rapidly change the direction the mouse is moving without much effort and it could lead to better performance playing shooters in particular.Both the Taipan and the Viper Ultimate have rubber grips on the sides of the mouse, and I think It's a really nice feature of both.  I've used wireless mice in the past, a Microsoft one that failed me several times in the heat of battle that used AAA batteries.  I was really unsure about using a wireless mouse again but I figured it was about time to try one again, possibly the technology has improved over the years and certainly it has.  I was tempted by the Razer Orochi v2 but I didn't want to be buying batteries over and over.  I think the Viper Ultimate is a bit better for my personal preferences and I really do like it.  I was watching some YouTube videos analyzing the latency differences between current wireless mice and wired mice.  For the first time I think wireless mice are so competitive with wired mice its there is no major reason to be using a wired mouse outside of cost.  The Razer Viper Ultimate is a great example of this.  There may be a valid argument that the Viper 8k has superior performance over the Viper Ultimate Wireless but the mice refresh rate is so far above what most monitors can display at 1000Hz pooling rate It doesn't feel like there is a major reason to be concerned about it.  Not only that but I've heard the processing required to keep track of the cursor at 8000Hz actually drops your in game frame rate by about 3-4 frames per second (depending on your hardware configuration of course).  I don't see the benefit of a 8000Hz pooling rate right now.  In the end I think it's a great time to transition to a wireless mouse if your interested in it and are able to afford it.I purchased the version of the Viper Ultimate which included the dock and I'm glad I did.  The dock has a magnet on it which makes far easier to rest the mouse on the dock in the correct position for it to charge and you really just don't have to think about dropping the mouse on the dock, the convenience is great.  My only complaint about the dock is that it's so light that sometimes I pull up on the mouse and the dock actually lifts off my desk because the magnet is strong enough to carry the weight of the dock for a few seconds before it drops.  I guess the engineers of the mouse decided to add a sticky pad on the bottom of the dock to help with this but I think this is a lame solution.  A weighted dock design would be far superior in my opinion and hopefully it will be included in a future release.  I don't like the thought of a sticky pad on my desk, it might make a gross sticky mess (which thankfully it hasn't) and possibly will become a hard dusty mass in a few years time anyway.  That's really my biggest complaint with the mouse/dock combo.A minor issue I have with the mouse itself is the Teflon feet.  I wish there was a larger Teflon pad at the back end of the mouse, or maybe two separate feet that are larger that covers that back end area a bit better.  In the past I've used mice for years and years on end before replacing them and the back end of the mouse get's the most feet pad wear (at least for me).  I feel like the Viper Ultimate may not last as long just because the back end feet are not significant enough and they are positioned far to the sides of the mouse, to the point I'll be lifting the mouse up off the mousepad surface and then setting it down, back down back end first and dragging the plastic of the mouse on the plastic mousepad surface for a few moments before the Teflon feet make contact with the mousepad.  This is not ideal in my opinion.Razer synapse, I personally don't mind running software in the background for peripherals as long as it doesn't take up too many system resources and Synapse doesn't.  I HATE the way one has to log into an account to make use of some of the features.  No mouse should require one to create an account to make full use of a mouse, that is a garbage idea for user convenience.  I personally think convenience should be prioritized over most aspects of a products design and this causes me anger every time the synapse software asks me for the password that I usually have forgotten in the weeks that go by where I don't have to enter the password.  Even if I tell it to remember my password the Synapse software still asks me for my password from time to time (I think when it does an update).  It's difficult for me to put into words how rage inducing this is, mostly because it feels so unnecessary.  The software should remember your password no matter what, #1 and #2 you should not need to create an account to make use of mouse software, It's trash on two fronts.  Okay, Razer is a business and they feel like they require minor tracking of their customer base so they can make better business decisions and satisfy customers.  I don't like it at all but hypothetically I can understand.  Message to Razer: Make the Synapse software remember your log in info no matter what.  This software design is just as important as your hardware design work.  For over half of the use of my Razer Taipan I didn't use Synapse at all because it was such a pain in the rear end to make sure I'm logged in all the time.  This may indeed only be an issue with the older version of Synapse, so far I haven't had this issue since purchasing the Viper Ultimate.  I really hope Razer has resolved this and I no longer will be plagued with login requests.In the end very few products are perfect and it is hard to fault the Viper Ultimate Wireless with very much.  I think it's a product worth buying and I'm glad I purchased it, I hope it will last me a few years and be a valuable part of my gaming hardware arsenal.  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing this mouse, I wouldn't hesitate too much, its pretty awesome overall.  It is a bit more pricy compared to some wired options but I do prefer wireless over a corded mouse even with a cord bungie (which are really great by the way).  Definitely consider the Viper Ultimate Wireless mouse if your in the market for a mouse, It's a great option in my opinion, despite my complaints."}
{"asin": "B09TG6KG2T", "username": "David D.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer Viper Ultimate - No Snake Oil Here, the new King of Mice", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2019", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackStyle: Mouse + Dock", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Razer Viper Ultimate ReviewThis has been a killer year for Razer in their product lineup. From keypads, to keyboards, and now mice as well. The Viper Ultimate is Razer’s one-two punch answer to the Logitech G Pro wireless, which is now getting on over a year old, and it is quite the response. Featuring an incredibly comfortable and sleek ambidextrous design, the Viper Ultimate stands tall amongst its peers, offering one of the best gaming experiences you can have with a mouse.Razer designed the original wired Viper with a key feature set in mind – creating a light, fast, wickedly responsive and premium gaming mouse and the Viper Ultimate adds to that with the addition of wireless connectivity. Long gone are the days of wireless mice being shunned by gamers and only being reserved for travel or general purpose use, wireless mice now stand at the forefront of gaming with offerings from Razer, Corsair, Logitech, Steelseries and other major manufacturers as upgrades to their wired siblings.The Viper and Viper Ultimate offer an extremely comfortable shape and design that really shows how far Razer has come with their mouse design. Subtle comfort grooves in the buttons, crisp button presses, well-stepped mouse wheel, and extremely comfortable rubber sides really make the mouse feel premium. The Viper is ideal for medium to medium-large hands, offering comfortable grip options for both palm, claw, and hybrid grip styles. Fingertip grip is possible here, but not recommended as the mouse as a longer body that is not well suited to fingertip grip styles. Integrated firm rubber sides, textured matte plastic body, and super comfortable shape for left and right handed users really take the spotlight. The mouse has side buttons on both sides, but are cleverly designed so that you never have to worry about accidental presses on either side, and even if you are worried about still somehow hitting the side buttons on the opposite side of the mouse – it is a simple enough task to go into the software and disable them. The mouse is also extremely rigid and sturdy, having no flex or bowing at all, there is a slight rattle but I think it is either in the mouse wheel or lens of the sensor. Not sure though, but it is nothing to be worried about, pretty standard fare there, though I would like to see that eliminated in the future., Lighting is minimal, with the only RGB goodness being the classic Razer logo on the butt of the mouse being lit up, but the charging stand also has an RGB LED on its base and integrates seamlessly into the Razer Chroma ecosystem and works as expected.Ultra low latency, long battery life, and ditching the cable drag are great bullet points for any wireless mouse manufacturer to have – but only a few have managed to add “under 100g” to that list. Logitech launched their G Pro wireless last year with a surprising 78g weight that was lighter than most wired mice, and now that smaller, lighter mice are in – it was the perfect time for Razer to fire back. The Viper Ultimate weighs in at a shockingly light and nimble 74g (2.6 ounces), beating out everything but the Glorious Model O series, the Finalmouse UItralight 2, and the Coolermaster MM710. And at 74g, I would gladly give up my Finalmouse’s ultra-feathery light weight for a better shape and wireless capabilities. I’d also be shocked if we didn’t see an even lighter Viper out next year with the ever popular honey comb design and even lighter materials, I’m almost positive that they could get the weight below 50g with relative ease.So we have a masterful recipe for success here with a great weight and balance, wireless connectivity, and sleek design and shape, but what about the internals?I am glad to say that the inside of the Viper and Viper Ultimate are just as well designed as the outside. The sensor is the result of the partnership between PixArt and Razer, and what they’ve brought with the 3399 is an incredibly fast, accurate, top-of-the line optical sensor that is near flawless in its execution. While the reported resolution of the sensor goes up to a true 20,000 cpi – we all know that none of us will ever even come close to using that level of granularity given that the overwhelming majority of gamers use 2000 dpi or lower. But it is nice to know that the option is there – in the event that we have 20K displays. The bottom is equipped with pure 100% PTFE feet without any dye positioned at the corners of the mouse and around the sensor itself. The absence of the black dye means there is zero grittiness to the glide of the mouse when moving it, and rivals that of aftermarket mouse feet like Hyperglides. The only reason you’ll ever need to replace these feet is if they ever wear out, they’re as good as mouse feet get. The clicks are satisfying and tactile, offering an instant response due to their opto-electric nature. Speaking of which, the opto-electric switches are great! Because there are no actual contacts, the switches have an incredibly long lifespan, over 50 million clicks and are immune to double-clicking that their mechanical microswitch brethren are notorious for.Included with the mouse is a charging dock that functions both as a home for the wireless receiver if you so choose and as a convenient and fast way to charge the mouse when not in use. Simply plop the mouse on the dock when you walk away to get a drink or go to bed, it is as simple as that – not that you’ll need to do that very often. The Viper Ultimate sports a staggeringly impressive maximum battery life of 70+ hours on one charge, and can be charged from 0-80% in 90 minutes or less. The cable used to plug into the charging dock can be used to connect the mouse directly to the computer to be used in a wired state, if you for some reason should want to do that. It is very lightweight and flexible, only ever so slightly stiffer than the Viper wired cable. Let’s be real here though, if you’re buying a wireless mouse only to plug it in and use it wired, what are you doing?At $150, it might be a tough purchase for some – but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it. If you are looking for the absolute best wireless gaming mouse out there right now, the Viper Ultimate is it. There is little room for debate on whether or not the Viper Ultimate is the king of gaming mice in 2019. Ultimately though, the best mouse for you is the one that feels best in your hand. So many mice have top optical sensors and similar specs, that it comes down to personal preference in regards to the shape. For me, the Viper Ultimate shape fits my hands extraordinarily well, whereas the Finalmouse Ultralight 2 and Logitech G Pro wireless exist at opposite ends of comfort for me. The Ultralight 2 is too small for my hands, and the G Pro feels too much like a semi-circular plastic dome, but the Viper Ultimate is just right.If there’s anything I would consider changing it would be creating a honey-comb shell design that would further reduce the weight and possibly making the side buttons modular, similar to that of Logitech’s offerings so that if we so choose to could simply remove the side buttons for the side of the mouse that we are not using.Razer, 2019 is the year you came back hard. I love what you’re offering and I really hope 2020 brings as much if not more innovation to your future product lines. You guys are champions, once more."}
{"asin": "B09TG6KG2T", "username": "Ryan", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat so far but with a few issues that should be noted.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackStyle: Mouse + Dock", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Unfortunately most people probably only read 5 or 1 star reviews, but I feel I need to be honest.+ So far, sensor is good/accurate (of course).+ Optical switches don't feel quite as snappy but overall not that much different from mechanical ones. The switches are pretty much the entire reason I bought this mouse over other mice. I'M SO SICK OF THE DOUBLE CLICK ISSUE AND I'M PRAYING THIS FIXES IT. Happened to my original Naga, kept me from buying another Razer mouse but then it happened even worse to my Zowie EC2-A. They are about the same \"speed\" as normal switches. Latency isn't better or worse. You can test this online.+ This is my first wireless mouse and I'm pleased to say that wireless feels just as responsive  as wired mode. VERY nice to not have to deal with a wire anymore and not have any downsides.+ Good customization within Synapse such as button programming, lighting, power-saving mode threshold, custom DPI, lift-off distance, etc.+ Saving to onboard memory is great, as is having the option to log in to synapse as Guest.+ Different methods of using and charging the mouse is really nice.+ Feet are good. No issues and glide nicely on a QCK Heavy. Texture on the shell is good and grippy. I prefer this textured plastic over a rubber coating. Rubber sides feel good. Grippy and not mushy at all. Mouse wheel has good feedback and feels good to scroll (for now) and has a nice grippy texture. Side buttons and scroll wheel feel pretty good to click and the NORMAL ones aren't in the way (left side for right-handed, right side for left-handed). There's no play/travel distance on the side buttons like there is on some mice like my old EC2-A.+ Battery life seems good. Going to actually test it now on full charge with lighting off but so far it seems as-advertised, at least for the most part.- After leaving it charging all night through the direct connection and from maybe around 20%, Synapse only read a 97% charge. I restarted Synapse to see if it was reading wrong but it still read 97%. I placed it on the dock for a few minutes and it fully charged to 100%. Not sure what that's about but thought I'd mention it. Will test this more.- Unsure if it's just Windows 7 not playing nice with it, but when switching modes, the mouse sometimes doesn't allow me to interact with things outside of my online browser. For example,  I'll switch from wired to wireless mode and I'll be able to move my cursor and interact with my  browser but NOTHING else is interactable until I restart the Windows explorer process. I can't highlight icons, close or open programs, windows or anything. Very strange and really hope this won't be an ongoing issue.- Could be an issue on my end but Synapse doesn't recognize the mouse or dock on either of my USB 3.0 ports. ONLY when I use the wireless receiver by itself does it recognize the mouse in Synapse. If the receiver is in the dock or even if the wire is connected directly to the mouse, Synapse will not pick it up. I still have function but can't change any settings until I use a USB 2 port. Ports work fine with other hardware.- Just a few days in and, though still good, the mouse wheel has slightly lost some of it's  snappiness in it's scroll and the left and right clicks have developed a slight give. Somewhat  nitpicking here, but I would really hate it if the mouse felt like crap to use in just a few months.  For the price, this things should be rock solid for years and not develop that mushy cheapness.- Didn't think I would, but I constantly press the sidebuttons on the right side when I'm aiming (I use it in my right hand). I had to disable them through Synapse. Thankfully you can and then save the setting to internal  memory. Unfortunately, I can't use them now for other things if I wanted to, such as  volume control.- Some part of the Razer software (Razer Synapse Service Process) stays running even after you select \"Exit All Apps\" from the  tray icon. This happened with my old Razer Naga too. Normally, I wouldn't care THAT much, but this particular process KILLS fps in my games. I literally have to end the process or games stutter like crazy for some reason, or at least Overwatch does.- Really just personal opinion, but it'd be nice if Razer would make some smaller mice. Pretty much all of their mice are too big in one way or another for someone with smaller hands and depending on how you grip. This one is just a bit too long for me personally.Overall, I think if it lasts and the shell doesn't become mushy and creaky like it very well may with enough use, it's everything a competitive FPS player would ever need IF (big if) the mouse fits your hand well. Measure your hands and decide for yourself. Mine are roughly...H 7.25 inches x W 4.25 inches (H 18.415 cm x W 10.795 cm)3 finger width (index, middle, ring) =  2.125 inches (5.3975 cm)Middle finger + knuckle = 4 1/4 inches (10.795 cm)And I probably fall somewhere between claw and fingertip grip, probably leaning more towards fingertip.--------------------------------------------So far, for me, after less than one week with the mouse:Performance: 10/10Comfort: 6.5/10 (subjective and also still getting used to the shape so likely to go up, but hitting sidebuttons accidentally sucks - also my first ambidextrous)Feedback: 8.5/10 (this will get lower if the shell quality doesn't hold and the snappiness diminishes)Quality: 8/10 (mostly concerned about long-term quality here as left/right buttons already have some slight give/shake to them after a few days of use and the scroll doesn't feel like it's going to hold it's feeling of precision and snappiness in it's steps - otherwise though, pretty solid)Software: 7/10 (good options but a little too bloated - can thankfully choose which software you'd like to install)Value: 7/10 (I got it on sale for $120 but I think it's worth more around $100 - if it was perfect for my hand and grip, $120 would be kind of okay maybe, however twice the price of the wired is high enough - full price is simply too much and in the end, I might come to regret not just buying two $60 mice and a bungee)Currently, this mouse is hovering around an 8 or 8.5/10 for me. This is likely to go up to a 9 with use and as I get used to it's size and shape, just as long as quality and performance stays the same as it is now. Overall I commend Razer for innovating and listening to it's customers and I hope to enjoy this mouse with no issue for years to come."}

That should say how much I use my mouse, not counting how rough I am on my mice, such as when sliding & lifting them across my mouse-pad or the occasional accidental drop. This lead me to typically only buy Razer mice, because all of the other main brand mice usually break around the 5 month mark for me.This is not to mention my original Razer Deathadder V1 mouse lasted 7 years of VERY harsh daily use, and only failed because its scroll-wheel broke. (Abbreviating Deathadder to DA from now on)That's not to say I haven't had issues with Razer products, my first DA V2 lasted 1 week until both the left click and the scroll wheel started failing leading me to then use the other brand name mice; G502 Hero lasted 5 months, Corsair M55 lasted 2 weeks,and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste lasted 3 months.My next Razer product was a DA V2 pro and that one lasted 2 years, Which led me to buy this one after that one started not sensing right clicks.Issues:I had zero issues with it for 8 months, then, entirely out of random, started having weird issues with connectivity.  This started out with very minuscule connectivity issues, such as it waiting 30 seconds for my PC and Razer's software to start working properly to use the mouse when it gets turned on after being off for a while.This was annoying, but I didn't care too much about that since I could still do whatever I needed to do.But fast forward ~4 months and the issues have compounded a little bit and I get my connection cut off when playing games for a solid 4 seconds at a time, and at this point this is getting REALLY annoying to endure (This happens plugged in too).At this point I am also having issues with the mouse having a slowed reception & it being able to hold a charge for more than half a day. I used to be able to use it at it's highest pulling rate and low brightness of the LED for 5 days without charging.Positives:Very durable plastic, I have very little wear on the mouse besides a bit of wear on the left click plastic making it shiny instead of matte black.Very comfortable if you claw grip your mouse (Not comfortable if you palm the entire mouse).Very light and easy to move on a mouse-pad.Fairly priced, ~$60 is quite decent for this mouse.Lasted 10 Months until having some bigger issues (Most mice completely break around the 5th month for me).Scroll wheel is perfect, zero squeaking (like a Corsair M55) or aggressive rumble feeling (like a Logitech G502) and has a good rubberized texture to it (HyperX Pulsefire haste didn't have any great texturing).Great for putting into a schoolbag for college or for storing in a laptop case.Buttons and sensor are great and feel immaculate.Cons:Either the USB dongle, or the mouse itself is having issues cutting out and not working at random after close to a year of use. The same with sensitivity, it has definitely gone down for the sensor.Battery is now starting to have issues holding a charge.This is where I am currently at with this mouse, It has worked very well for what it is, but I may soon have to upgrade, due to the issues I am having.You will probably have a longer service life on your mouse though, especially if you are not rough on your electronics.I would 100% recommend this if you need it for a laptop and need it to be wireless, or have smaller hands that are not as fitting for a Razer Deathadder."}

If you play a song that some guy hit the bass drum once, the cursor is moving on you. I've been playing FPS games all of my life, but I can't get the flick down for this mouse; the lack of weight gives 0 feedback to your hand. You are basically reactionary to everything. By that, I mean move the mouse first, react to how the screen moves, then adjust accordingly.

I frequently play Rainbow 6 Siege and OSU!, both games which are very reliant on the ability to aim. while I use the same DPI and sensitivity on this mouse as I have with my prior ones, this one for some reason makes aiming so much easier. The battery life is incredibly good averaging about 10-12 hours before needing a charge, and Razer software gives you a healthy heads up when your battery is getting low, so there's never a concern for it dying in game. The connection speed is incredibly fast, 0 notable latency while wireless, and it shows the same speed while wired and charging. My only complaint (which isn't worthy of being a complaint) is that the Razer symbol that glows, gets covered by your own hands, so you cant really see any of the LED effects that you set up."}

This mouse however, feels great and I love it.  I bought this to replace my Glorious Model O mouse because I wanted to go wireless.  It's amazing that this wireless mouse is only about 6 grams heavier than the Model O and it doesn't even need to have the hexagonal pattern on the case to remove weight.I spend a lot of time in first-person shooters like Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield when I'm not at my desktop doing normal daily web browsing and email reading.Here are some pros:- Feels very light, especially for a wireless mouse.- I don't sense any delay, even after I leave it sitting for a while.- It's very convenient to have a power button on the bottom of the mouse, and to have a charging dock to sit it on when not in use.- The button clicks are very satisfying - good sound, good force needed (not too much or too little for my taste).- Lighting is tasteful and not too overdone.- The finish on the mouse is nice to the touch - grippy on the sides, and smoothly textured elsewhere.- The side buttons are well-placed for my thumb.  Others have been a little too far forward for me.- The battery life seems great. I am part-way through my fifth day of use and the battery is at 51%.  I have been using it to play games every day for at least 3-5 hours per night plus regular Desktop duties for at least an hour each day as well.  I have not recharged it yet and I turn off the power at the end of each day when I am done with the mouse for the night.- The Synapse software is much better than I expected and has not crashed for me once.  It's pretty easy to understand and laid out fairly well.  It's great that it will change profiles for me automatically based on the games I start up, then go back to my \"desktop\" profile after I close the game.Here are some cons (for mouse, and Synapse software):- I miss the extra button on top of the mouse that my Model O had.  I wish this mouse had that extra button near the scroll wheel.  I have had to use one of the right-side buttons instead.  Although the right-side buttons are not as easy to press for me (since I'm a right-handed user) I'm getting used to them for desktop use.- I find the lighting options a bit confusing with regards to the \"Quick\" effects and the \"Advanced\" effects in the Synapse software.  Mostly, it's frustrating that only the Quick effects are stored on the mouse with the profiles and not the Advanced effects.  I think this means that if you want to use any of the Advanced effects, they will not be saved on the mouse and I'm not sure if they can be tied to games like the other profiles.  Before I can really fault the mouse or software for this one, I suppose I need to learn how to use it more.  Either way, I wish it were a little simpler to understand for first-time Synapse users like me.- I wish the mouse feet were \"slipperier\".  Compared to my Model O mouse, this mouse does not move across my cloth mouse mat as easily.  My no means is it \"not\" slippery, but it was noticeably less slippery when I was swapping them out.  Now that I have not used my Model O for about 5 days, I don't notice it any more or have any issues moving the mouse, but it would be nice to know that it was at least as free to move as the Model O.  This might turn into a plus as I get used to it because it may give me a little more \"control\".To summarize, I love this mouse!  It's been great to use so far and I'm very glad I switched back to this wireless option.  Lot's to like here and the software (despite some shortcomings) is much better than I expected and seems mostly mature and works well."}

I love this mouse and bought it around a year ago, with little to no issues.The only real complaint I have is the charging dock. The battery life on the mouse is fine and will last you all day, but the charger is annoying. Both of my brothers purchased this mouse previously, and we all had our charging docks randomly stop working after months of use. What happens is the mouse will charge for a second which wakes it up, then stop and loop that so it’s constantly on all night and just dies. The past few times I turned on my computer, I would take the mouse off the charger, just to see it blinking red and require a charge. The charger seems to work almost all of the time, but for some reason, it refuses to charge at night and will drain the battery. My brothers both had to get different mice, and I think I need to do the same. It does come with a wire so that you can use the mouse wired, but that defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse obv. We could've just bought another charger, but at that point, I'll just get a new more reliable wireless mouse. All in all, not a bad mouse, just a bad charging unit that seems to not be functional for many after around a year of use."}

I honestly did love the mouse, but I'm returning it.PROS+It has upgraded feet (even though you *can* upgrade the G Pro feet, goodluck. The hyperglides are 10x the MSRP at the time of writing this and looking at their cost history). Having it out of the box is a huge bonus as well.+The Razer has a hair of a better of a sensor. This will likely go unnoticed though.+A big difference between the two are the switches. Razer have \"fixed\" the G Pro's double-click issue by creating optical switches. It has a little bit less of a loud and satisfying click, but they still feel fine, especially after getting used to them.+Side-by-side I significantly prefer the textures on the Viper. I like the rubberized grips and the texturized plastic on top. The G PRO in a half-day's use already looks \"shiny\" and slightly greasy on both mouse buttons.+It objectively has longer battery life than the G Pro as well.+In terms of weight, the Viper slightly beats out the G Pro and if you're getting the wireless charging pad for the G Pro it will be even more noticeable. After using the Viper for 2 weeks I can tell you the logitech it is noticable it's lighter, contrary to some of the Youtubers telling you it's not. I'd guess that most of them didn't actually use both mice for enough time to tell. I can very much so, especially with the noticeably worse feet. Viper just glides better on the pad because of less weight and better feet.CONS- Too ambidextrous for the grip style required. I sometimes click the right side in tense moments of gaming. Not often at all, but 1-2 times every 2-3 days. These can simply be turned off in Razer’s software though.- I found the mouse flatter than G Pro and it made it a little less comfortable. Great for claw grip, but I have a hybrid of resting my index/pinky finger corner of my palm and it's hard to do. It's still mostly comfortable after getting used to, but after trying out the G Pro, I think the Viper would have just been more comfortable and a better mouse if it had just a tiny bit more height to it (for my grip style).Both of those I can get over if I get used to them. So can you, or you don't. Those are subjective to whatever grip you prefer. Button issues are not.- ** Quality Control ** -  I'd keep this mouse over the G Pro if I could get one that's free of issues. I think it's better than the G Pro, personally. BUT the creeky right click with a slight wobble and hair of a pre-travel just bothers me too much. There are times I'm not gaming and just sitting there and the weight of my pinky causes it to creak and wobble down through the pre-travel distance. It's extremely dissatisfying every time it happens. When I game I mostly forget about this. The left click also feels totally fine. For the one that is working, MB1, the \"Mushy\" language the Youtubers are using is hyperbole. They're not, they just don't have a crisp snippy click, it's more a clock.  Also, again, I don't even notice this when I'm gaming.Another note on \"Mushy\", go test your reaction speed on a website and you'll not notice any difference. I didn't, my speed was pretty consistent with my old G502. So once you give it a week or two of the mouse, you won't notice it and it's not impacting your gaming.**Update **Third mouse was a charm. I recommend getting replacements until you get one that doesn’t have the travel on either click.Also, I went into Razer’s software and killed the right side buttons I had previously hit. Problem solved.This is just the better mouse than G Pro, it’s worth trying to get one without problems. G Pro might initially not have problems, but who knows if UT double clicks months from purchase."}

I didn't splurge for the dock, but I chose this over the G Pro Wireless and am now curious to know if that mouse would've been sufficient for me. I use fingertip grip most of the time so I wanted an ambidextrous mouse with buttons on the right side for more keymaps that I can activate with my ring finger. The side buttons are handy when playing fast paced games (build/abilities/armor in a battle royale, for example), but I just use them for Overwatch voice lines and system volume control elsewhere (left side is push to talk and melee)Mouse works great and is easy to set up. There is no noticeable lag in wireless compared to wired mode and when compared to my Steelseries Sensei 310 (which has developed double clicking issues). Time will tell if these switches will exhibit the same click issues (hopefully not, since they are optical).-Synapse issues-I've noticed the Synapse software causes performance issues on my PC so I keep it closed. This mouse is commonly reviewed as not requiring the Synapse software to function. What I didn't read until I had the issues was that, while you can cycle through onboard profiles without Synapse, you have no control over the lighting.On my other mice, I would color code my profiles, which is impossible here. Even though Steelseries requires the app to switch profiles, it's never given me gameplay issues other than the rare, random freeze. With the Viper Ultimate I do plan to use the DPI LED to identify what profile is active instead. I use 1600 DPI for non-gaming but prefer 800 DPI for gaming. Theoretically I'd set the blue LED (3rd DPI setting i think?) to my normal profile then use the red and green LEDs for two other profiles and unfortunately not have a 4th profile...or have two profiles use one DPI LED. You'd have to set multiple DPI points in order to use the other profiles but none of my profile make use of the DPI cycle button mapping and use the button under mouse to cycle through profiles instead.Another issue with not being able to identify the profile used is that it remembers the last profile used with Synapse. You need to make note of what's active when you close Synapse or else you'll have one of your profiles appear randomly (for a second time) in your list of onboard profiles it will cycle through.Several times I've also opened Synapse to see that it has cleared all of its onboard profiles. This is minor since loading your profiles is as simple as dragging them one by one to the memory banks in Synapse. Not sure when this happens, but I wonder if Synapse or the battery charging process are messing it up.If Razer would allow lighting profiles to be saved to the mouse without requiring Synapse to be open (just issue separate firmware for non tournament play), I'd say the Viper Ultimate is an easy recommendation. Maybe other people don't care about having the software open, but for myself I would consider all my options and whether or not wireless is a must.Conclusion-Lighting profiles can't be saved to onboard memory.-Nice cable that charges but can also work with the little adapter to extend a USB port. It holds the wireless dongle when the mouse isn't charging over the cable, which is a micro USB cable with a proprietary angled shape.-Great so far for gaming, and it's sold me on wireless.-Thumbs down on the Synapse software because it needs to be open and sometimes affects gaming performance, but it's easy to use. Have not tried any other Razer apps besides the Macro manager.UPDATE: I discovered there are 5 colors for the underside LED so I can actually use this to color code all my profiles. Still wish I could actually turn off or make use of the top RGB LED while Synapse is closed."}

Before this became my main, I had been using the Razer Viper and Razer Viper 8k respectively. I bought the 8k after I accidentally damaged the rubber grips on my gen 1 razer viper. (learn from me, don't be harsh with the microfiber cloth on the grips. that black stuff coming off isn't dirt.) I was actually disappointed with the Viper 8k due to its much thicker cable causing a lot of drag, even with a mouse bungee. That's what influenced me to finally go wireless, and I won't ever look back. The battery on the Viper Ultimate is really good. I can forget to charge it for 2 days before it gets low. It's a little bit heavier than the wired Viper and Viper Pro, but i've gotten used to it. Unfortunately you have to have Synapse open, Razer's periferal software, in order to retain certain settings like RGB, but DPI and i think liftoff distance gets saved in the onboard memory.The reason I took a star away is mostly due to purchasing used from Amazon Warehouse, which is always going to have a small risk. The package didn't include a charging cable (I didn't buy the MagSafe charger), and the micro-USB port is very narrow so none of my spare cables fit. I was able to solve this issue by using a dremel and nail file to grind down a micro-USB cable to fit. It looks like when using the intended cable it's supposed to slide in so if you actually get the cable in the package, it looks really convenient. The scroll wheel feels like it's touching some kind of smooth plastic when pressing down slightly and scrolling, but again that could be due to buying used. The mouse buttons can be very sensitive, but I only really notice this when picking it up and not when actually using it. Overall I am very happy with this mouse and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a light wireless mouse without any holes punched in."}

And guess when the warranty for Corsair mice ends? Right, 2 years.The software is also terribly designed. The interface makes no sense. Sometimes i forget what i mapped a button to do so i want to check what it does, but when i click into the button, it remaps it!?!? why!?? in order to view what a mapped button does, you have to click through the side panel of the actions you've mapped, and then see which button it highlights on the mapping screen. very unintuitive.  <insert joke designer should not design UI interfaces>I was considering getting the wireless version since it just came out, but I think i'll pass since i can't stand the software. may try the razer mouse next."}

Simple trouble shooting fixed the issue. Unplug the mouse; wait 10 sec. When you plug it back in hold both mouse buttons simultaneously. That will reset the mouse, and the buttons should work. Note: If the wheel and the left and right click buttons do not work before this, it is not a software issue."}

Really loved it, until it started giving me problems.  The cursor would intermittently get stuck for 1-2 secs then unstick itself.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but in the middle of a game (moba, fps), it could mean the diff b/w life and death, and this issues has gotten me killed many times in a match. it was very frustrating.  And guess when the warranty for Corsair mice ends? Right, 2 years.The software is also terribly designed. The interface makes no sense. Sometimes i forget what i mapped a button to do so i want to check what it does, but when i click into the button, it remaps it!?!? why!?? in order to view what a mapped button does, you have to click through the side panel of the actions you've mapped, and then see which button it highlights on the mapping screen. very unintuitive.  <insert joke designer should not design UI interfaces>I was considering getting the wireless version since it just came out, but I think i'll pass since i can't stand the software. may try the razer mouse next."}

I think keeping the scroll wheel between the clicks made sense at first but eventually felt awkward. The front and back buttons were comfortable to use and the click buttons also felt fine. The mouse worked well but eventually, it stopped charging and the USB no longer worked, displaying an error that wasn't resolved with troubleshooting or restarting. Even on different devices it no longer worked. I tried connecting it directly to the laptop with the wire I used to charge it and that didn't work as well.

It only got worse with more use to the point where the middle mouse button hardly functioned at all and would even scroll the screen randomly without me touching it.Eventually, I decided to get rid of it and get a new one and haven't had problems ever since. I'd say this is a good entry-level mouse to get used to the feel of ergonomic mice, but just don't expect it to last very long."}

I used the mouse with a small foam support and it seemed to alleviate any issues that stretching my wrist couldn't help. The mouse feels like giving someone a handshake which can be awkward at first but quickly makes sense. It has a left and right click, a scroll wheel, and a back and forward button. I think keeping the scroll wheel between the clicks made sense at first but eventually felt awkward. The front and back buttons were comfortable to use and the click buttons also felt fine. The mouse worked well but eventually, it stopped charging and the USB no longer worked, displaying an error that wasn't resolved with troubleshooting or restarting. Even on different devices it no longer worked. I tried connecting it directly to the laptop with the wire I used to charge it and that didn't work as well. I don't think it's a bad device for the price, I just think that finding a better manufacturer or splurging for one from a more trustworthy company makes sense for those who need a mouse like this."}

This can be pretty annoying as it will mess up your movements, either by potentially getting caught on things, or just making it less smooth. To fix this, you either can get double sided tape or better rubber footing, which when put on the bottom prevents a lot of the movement issues. The product is heavy, but not heavy enough to prevent moving with sudden adjusements which isn't good for shooters.However, once you've added tape or whatever solution you have, it's great at what it does.Since it's currently on a discount, I think that the value is worth it, but when it full priced there might be better options that don't move nearly as much"}

{"asin": "B07QX9C9WH", "username": "Ray", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nThis mouse feels like it was made for my hand", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020", "purchased": "Style: Nightsword / Wired", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Impressions after 1 week. May update if something goes wrong later, otherwise see you in a few years.----------------------------------------------------------------------My hands measure 18 x 10 cm and I use a palm grip. Length is measured from tip of middle finger to base of palm, and width is measured from edge of pinky to edge of thumb when all fingers are placed together.I've mained 4 mice over the years, including this one. M65 RGB, M65 RGB Elite, Razer Basilisk x Hyperspeed, and this Corsair Nightsword. The original M65 RGB was a real tank that lasted me 5+ years of hard usage. The switches are still 100% responsive, but I ruined the surface coat with acetone so I upgraded to the Elite. The M65 Elite started losing responsiveness in the left click after 4 months. The Basilisk x Hyperspeed was meant to be my wireless mouse while commuting. It felt decently comfortable in store and the shape was very well done except for a slightly-off hump placement, but after a while of using it, I realized the mouse was not wide enough for my hands, which would cause some discomfort after continuous use. But for my typical not-so-heavy usage while on the go, it is acceptable. The M65/Elite (both have nearly the same form factor) has been my daily driver for nearly 6 years so I will be doing a lot of comparison with it.Now the reason I'm talking about all these other mice is so you can get other comparisons of what mice I find comfortable. Mouse shape is the most subjective and also important factor when choosing a mouse. In particular grip width matters the most. I didn't think I had massive hands but apparently I do. To this date the only other mouse that has felt comfortable to me is the Corsair M65. I've tried all sorts of mice from Logitech and Razer, that all had raving reviews, including the G502 which the Nightsword was modeled after. All of them felt extremely uncomfortable to me with poor hump placement, small grip width, uncomfortable side button positioning, etc. The Roccat Kone Aimo supposedly also has a good size for my hands, but I have yet to try it out as stores will rarely put Roccats on display.----------------------------------------------------------------------Anyways, about the actual Nightsword.Feel/Comfort:This mouse feels like it was literally made for my hands. My hand dimensions are a little unusual, even compared to other 18 x 10 cm hands, as I have very long fingers relative to my palm size. This makes it even more difficult to find a good mouse. I can't really describe the feeling when I first tried it out in store before. I have never felt this level of comfort on any mouse, not even the M65, which is pretty comfortable, but not on this level. The Nightsword has curves in all the right places, buttons at the right positions, and my hand can rest on it effortlessly without having to cramp up my palm at all. The thumb wing is extremely nice as well. The sniper button is placed right near the tip of my thumb, which is the ideal position to hit it without having to bend or stretch at all. I can easily swing my thumb up to hit the forward and back buttons above it. The DPI switches which are cut out of the left click take some more effort to hit, but I don't really use them much for now. Still figuring out the optimal way to hit them. I can actually reach one comfortably with my thumb, and the other with my index finger.Weight:This mouse is way too heavy, even with all weights removed. I have to actually consciously grip the mouse a bit harder than usual when trying to lift the mouse up, otherwise it feels like it would slip out of my hand. Combined with the high LOD on this thing, it kind of feels like Corsair doesn't intend for you to ever lift the mouse. Center of gravity adjustment is a cool idea, but it feels like a gimmick right now.Sensor:The Nightsword uses the same PMW3391 optical sensor as the M65 Elite. Now here's the thing...for some unknown reason the Nightsword falls short of the M65 Elite's performance, despite having the same sensor. People say with high end mice, the sensor isn't a spec to look at because they are all practically the same, but I disagree. I have tried many different sensors that are all in this DPI range and 1000 Hz polling rate, but nothing else has felt as as silky smooth as the M65 Elite. In fact, not even the Nightsword with the same sensor feels as smooth. It's still great performance, but after experiencing the M65 elite, something is just lacking in the smoothness.The Lift-Off Distance (LOD) is also different from the M65 Elite. It feels ridiculously high, which is bad. The M65 Elite with the exact same sensor has one of the lowest LOD's on the market, at a height of 1 DVD thickness. The Nightsword is nearly 3 DVD's in LOD, while 2 is the current industry standard. This seems to be a common issue in other reviews, so it is definitely not a one-off.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buttons:This is really one of the huge flawed areas of this mouse. It seems like corsair got all the button actuation forces backwards.* L/R click:Split trigger buttons (buttons are completely separate cutouts from the main body of the mouse) and highly sensitive. I personally dislike split trigger but some people may disagree on this. When you have split trigger buttons there is less \"springiness\" and long term feedback to the button. If you need to hold down left or right click a lot for extended periods of time, this becomes a problem. It is very easy to accidentally let go of the button when you don't have that slight feedback of the button trying to spring back against your finger. Or, over time you start to press harder and harder which is also bad. The M65 Elite which was not split trigger had the perfect amount of feedback in my opinion. Split trigger can also sometimes jam the skin of your fingers in between the button, which was a problem on the Basilisk, but so far I haven't had this issue with the Nightsword. I also find the Nightsword L/R click to be a bit too sensitive. The first few days of use, I was constantly triggering the buttons by accident just by resting my hand on it, but I've adjusted now and it no longer happens.* Scroll/Middle click:Scrolling feels pretty good. It could be a tad bit less mushy, but I can still easily scroll one tick at a time and it doesn't ever move by accident. The middle click however, has some issues. It is not as firm as it should be. Applying a slight downward force without actuating it causes it to give way a bit and create a barely-audible creaking feedback as though the scroll wheel is loose.* Sniper Button:Interestingly enough this is actually the best button on this mouse. Perfect positioning, perfect actuation force. Well done.* Forward/Back:Takes WAY too much force to press. My thumb feels like it became 3x more buff after trying to hold down macros on these buttons (seriously). Additionally, the 2 buttons sometimes get stuck on each other. Press one, and it pushes on the other one, or sometimes even catches on the other when trying to release (you hear 2 \"clicks\" as the button tries to come back up). They are also slightly wobbly.* Profile Shift:Not too much to say about these except that they should be less sensitive. You'd think that they're pretty out of the way, but I have actually swapped profiles by accident a couple of times already. When flipping the mouse over to try out the weight system, they would constantly keep triggering just from the weight of the mouse.* DPI Shift:These have the same sensitivity as the L/R click, so I have the same opinion on that. The main thing about these is the shape.

The textured surface seems to just be asking for gunk to get stuffed in the holes and be impossible to clean. We'll see. Scroll wheel and Forward/Back buttons could be less wobbly as I described before but otherwise build quality is very good.----------------------------------------------------------------------Final comments for Corsair:I really want to see you guys combine all the best things into one mouse. The form factor of the Nightsword + the M65 Elite's sensor, button build quality, material, and button actuation forces + optical switches (a lot of left/right click problems with many of your recent mice) + less weight, and maybe wireless. That would be my dream mouse."}

This can be a serious issue when playing video games or creating art/graphic design. Imagine in a game, trying to click an item in your inventory only to have it repeatedly put it back down right away, or anywhere where a rapid double click could cause unwanted effects.Not only this, but the software is terrible. I am currently using this mouse, a corsair keyboard, and a corsair AIO, the software has had a range of issues on and off. Sometimes my middle mouse wheel click won't function properly, but closing the software solves it, or the lights randomly go off and stay off on the AIO. The software has had various issues since I began using it after getting this mouse.I looked up the double click issue awhile ago, apparently Corsair has had this issue in other mice, and they continue to use the same manufacturer for the clicker despite all of the reported issues with it over the years. They seem to have no desire to resolve it.RECOMMENDATION: Stay away from Corsair peripherals. I know I will after this.EDIT UPDATE (not long after original review): So I contacted customer service, they were super helpful and sent me a replacement quickly and even allowed me to continue using the old mouse until I got it before sending the old one back. The process was virtually painless. I've been using the replacement for going on a year now without double clicking so far. I also did my research back then and found out many other common gaming mice brands have the same issue these days as many of them share the same OMRON switches that seem to have this issue more often. My research led me to mice that use other switches instead, but either those mice or those switches host their own issues.So, based on what you're looking for in a mouse, whether you need the extra features or not, another brand with another switch might be for you, if not, at least Corsair seems to have good customer service, so if it should start acting up on you, you'll be able to get a replacement.Because of my experience with customer service, and liking most of the other mouse features and ICUE software seeming to be better these days, I'll change my rating from 1 to 3.EDIT UPDATE (March 26th 2023):I'm adjusting my review to 4 stars. The replacement mouse I have been using now for almost 2 years without a single double clicking issue or other issues. I had a few mouse wheel abnormalities with the original mouse as well that I do not have with this one either. Perhaps I just got unlucky with a bad mouse the first time around, or perhaps I just got lucky with a good one this time around. I also have a backup that I purchased, unopened and unused from back when I got this replacement. I have yet to have need of it. Icou software has been running constantly on my computer for years now and I forget that it's there, which means it's been very good. The only time I should know it's there is when I want to use it to change something. I have ESC set on a mouse button and use it constantly, never had it fail.I will continue to update this over time, should I have any updates to make."}

This thing is absolutely perfect, comfortable and has more features than I will probably ever use or need.  The options in the Icue software are awesome, I can literally set the DPI to exactly what I want or need for what I'm doing at that moment and the DPI buttons make changing between profiles and 3 DPI settings per profile very easy.

So I can give a pretty good review on it.  For gaming it works! fits my wide hand perfectly! It has a good response and switches(aside from the profile/dpi) work like a charm. that is where the star falls.  When you browse on the web or do typing or blogs you are going to be scrolling an aweful lot!  When you do your scroll wheel so too close to the profile \"switch\" button. often times I find my mouse switching to a lower DPI profile and at basline speed (lowest setting DPI) when you switch profile it goes to the lowest DPI setting after switch! this is not good when browsing as you often fatfinger the scrollwheel/profile switch button and wonder why your mouse suddenly crawls to a snail's pace. dangerous in some cases if you want to avoid pop up banner click bait. at the very least annoying. and NO it is not a malware! you not someone else has switched your profile(more than likely) by fat fingering the scrollwheel/profile switch. the button and the wheel are too close together!  Also Corsair could make it where your new profile switch stays on the same DPI level as your old. for instance if you are on level two it needs to stay on level two when you switch from Proflie A to Profile B and C and so on. Would partially fix the problem. another thing: the switch and wheel should have a larger gap for people with larger fingers. not all of us are piano players you know... Some people complain about the scrollwheel being cheap plastic(at least on the other Scimitar) this one is also. I cannot judge as I have not had it long enough to know when/if it could(or not) break.  It feels okay, just okay, not too flimsy not sturdy though either. same with the Scimitar which I also have. This Nightsword WASP FPS mouse feels less cheap and more sturdy than the Scimitar. why? Probably because the weights in it give it that illusion but it also feels less mushy in clicking L/R the hand grip rubber is better quality and it has flanks on the side for stablity.  I find it works for both FPS and RPG games and I don't play too many stratigy games anyway.  If you use it I recommend programming iCUE on another PC to hardware settings(LTD as they are) and then safely utilizing the mouse on a computer without iCue loaded(unless you have a lightening fast machine or play offline as I often do)  If you program settings you can reprogram it later as many times as you want as you change or play different games.  Also browsing and Icue is dangerous these days! Icue reputedly opens up backdoors to your firewall. I'd just use it for programming hardware and leave it off or use another computer to play games on without iCue loaded."}

May update if something goes wrong later, otherwise see you in a few years.----------------------------------------------------------------------My hands measure 18 x 10 cm and I use a palm grip. Length is measured from tip of middle finger to base of palm, and width is measured from edge of pinky to edge of thumb when all fingers are placed together.I've mained 4 mice over the years, including this one. M65 RGB, M65 RGB Elite, Razer Basilisk x Hyperspeed, and this Corsair Nightsword. The original M65 RGB was a real tank that lasted me 5+ years of hard usage. The switches are still 100% responsive, but I ruined the surface coat with acetone so I upgraded to the Elite. The M65 Elite started losing responsiveness in the left click after 4 months. The Basilisk x Hyperspeed was meant to be my wireless mouse while commuting. It felt decently comfortable in store and the shape was very well done except for a slightly-off hump placement, but after a while of using it, I realized the mouse was not wide enough for my hands, which would cause some discomfort after continuous use. But for my typical not-so-heavy usage while on the go, it is acceptable. The M65/Elite (both have nearly the same form factor) has been my daily driver for nearly 6 years so I will be doing a lot of comparison with it.Now the reason I'm talking about all these other mice is so you can get other comparisons of what mice I find comfortable. Mouse shape is the most subjective and also important factor when choosing a mouse. In particular grip width matters the most. I didn't think I had massive hands but apparently I do. To this date the only other mouse that has felt comfortable to me is the Corsair M65. I've tried all sorts of mice from Logitech and Razer, that all had raving reviews, including the G502 which the Nightsword was modeled after. All of them felt extremely uncomfortable to me with poor hump placement, small grip width, uncomfortable side button positioning, etc. The Roccat Kone Aimo supposedly also has a good size for my hands, but I have yet to try it out as stores will rarely put Roccats on display.----------------------------------------------------------------------Anyways, about the actual Nightsword.Feel/Comfort:This mouse feels like it was literally made for my hands. My hand dimensions are a little unusual, even compared to other 18 x 10 cm hands, as I have very long fingers relative to my palm size. This makes it even more difficult to find a good mouse. I can't really describe the feeling when I first tried it out in store before. I have never felt this level of comfort on any mouse, not even the M65, which is pretty comfortable, but not on this level. The Nightsword has curves in all the right places, buttons at the right positions, and my hand can rest on it effortlessly without having to cramp up my palm at all. The thumb wing is extremely nice as well. The sniper button is placed right near the tip of my thumb, which is the ideal position to hit it without having to bend or stretch at all. I can easily swing my thumb up to hit the forward and back buttons above it. The DPI switches which are cut out of the left click take some more effort to hit, but I don't really use them much for now. Still figuring out the optimal way to hit them. I can actually reach one comfortably with my thumb, and the other with my index finger.Weight:This mouse is way too heavy, even with all weights removed. I have to actually consciously grip the mouse a bit harder than usual when trying to lift the mouse up, otherwise it feels like it would slip out of my hand. Combined with the high LOD on this thing, it kind of feels like Corsair doesn't intend for you to ever lift the mouse. Center of gravity adjustment is a cool idea, but it feels like a gimmick right now.Sensor:The Nightsword uses the same PMW3391 optical sensor as the M65 Elite. Now here's the thing...for some unknown reason the Nightsword falls short of the M65 Elite's performance, despite having the same sensor. People say with high end mice, the sensor isn't a spec to look at because they are all practically the same, but I disagree. I have tried many different sensors that are all in this DPI range and 1000 Hz polling rate, but nothing else has felt as as silky smooth as the M65 Elite. In fact, not even the Nightsword with the same sensor feels as smooth. It's still great performance, but after experiencing the M65 elite, something is just lacking in the smoothness.The Lift-Off Distance (LOD) is also different from the M65 Elite. It feels ridiculously high, which is bad. The M65 Elite with the exact same sensor has one of the lowest LOD's on the market, at a height of 1 DVD thickness. The Nightsword is nearly 3 DVD's in LOD, while 2 is the current industry standard. This seems to be a common issue in other reviews, so it is definitely not a one-off.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buttons:This is really one of the huge flawed areas of this mouse. It seems like corsair got all the button actuation forces backwards.* L/R click:Split trigger buttons (buttons are completely separate cutouts from the main body of the mouse) and highly sensitive. I personally dislike split trigger but some people may disagree on this. When you have split trigger buttons there is less \"springiness\" and long term feedback to the button. If you need to hold down left or right click a lot for extended periods of time, this becomes a problem. It is very easy to accidentally let go of the button when you don't have that slight feedback of the button trying to spring back against your finger. Or, over time you start to press harder and harder which is also bad. The M65 Elite which was not split trigger had the perfect amount of feedback in my opinion. Split trigger can also sometimes jam the skin of your fingers in between the button, which was a problem on the Basilisk, but so far I haven't had this issue with the Nightsword. I also find the Nightsword L/R click to be a bit too sensitive. The first few days of use, I was constantly triggering the buttons by accident just by resting my hand on it, but I've adjusted now and it no longer happens.* Scroll/Middle click:Scrolling feels pretty good. It could be a tad bit less mushy, but I can still easily scroll one tick at a time and it doesn't ever move by accident. The middle click however, has some issues. It is not as firm as it should be. Applying a slight downward force without actuating it causes it to give way a bit and create a barely-audible creaking feedback as though the scroll wheel is loose.* Sniper Button:Interestingly enough this is actually the best button on this mouse. Perfect positioning, perfect actuation force. Well done.* Forward/Back:Takes WAY too much force to press. My thumb feels like it became 3x more buff after trying to hold down macros on these buttons (seriously). Additionally, the 2 buttons sometimes get stuck on each other. Press one, and it pushes on the other one, or sometimes even catches on the other when trying to release (you hear 2 \"clicks\" as the button tries to come back up). They are also slightly wobbly.* Profile Shift:Not too much to say about these except that they should be less sensitive. You'd think that they're pretty out of the way, but I have actually swapped profiles by accident a couple of times already. When flipping the mouse over to try out the weight system, they would constantly keep triggering just from the weight of the mouse.* DPI Shift:These have the same sensitivity as the L/R click, so I have the same opinion on that. The main thing about these is the shape. I understand that the intention was to keep the contour of the left click intact, but I would have liked to see the DPI-down button raised slightly higher so that it can be hit by rolling the index finger, without hitting the other buttons around it by accident.----------------------------------------------------------------------Build/Materials:I really like the left and right click material a lot on this mouse. Feels like a really high quality matte plastic and repels dirt really well. The glossy plastic on the side buttons gunks up extremely quickly and I don't even have sweaty or oily hands. The rubberized material on the rest of the mouse seems alright for now but it seems like it could deteriorate very quickly if you tried to scrub it for any cleaning. The textured surface seems to just be asking for gunk to get stuffed in the holes and be impossible to clean. We'll see. Scroll wheel and Forward/Back buttons could be less wobbly as I described before but otherwise build quality is very good.----------------------------------------------------------------------Final comments for Corsair:I really want to see you guys combine all the best things into one mouse.

My third issue is the way the mouse slides across surfaces. Prior to this I was using a no name $30 ergo mouse, and that thing felt smooth as glass compared to this. It just feels and sounds abrasive, like it's being dragged instead of slid, at first I thought I must've forgotten to peel some film off the pads but after picking at them for a few minutes I was at a loss.I'm gonna try to get used to it and see it it doesn't get better, other reviews said this was a good mouse for people with large hands, the narrow finger channels kind of hamper that, at least if you use 3 fingers."}

It's larger and fits my hand a little better than the G502 (even with claw grip) with the same number of buttons and more lighting.  I was searching for a mouse that would stay in the Corsair ecosystem so I wouldn't need other software running along with all my other Corsair devices.  It feels great and the customizable weights make it move just the way I like it.  The lighting fully matches my other Corsair peripherals now and the buttons/macros are as just as easily programmed.  I'm also enjoying the rubberized scroll wheel--which I didn't have before.  Even though it's the same number of buttons, it functionally has one more programmable since my old mouse used a button to lock the free-wheel mouse (a feature I never used)."}
{"asin": "B07QX9C9WH", "username": "Soul Sojourner", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nDone with Corsair peripherals! -- Update: See Rating and Review updates, Good Mouse overall", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021", "purchased": "Style: Nightsword / Wired", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "Original review, Apr 28th 2021:In less than a year the left mouse button began double clicking on a single click. This can be a serious issue when playing video games or creating art/graphic design. Imagine in a game, trying to click an item in your inventory only to have it repeatedly put it back down right away, or anywhere where a rapid double click could cause unwanted effects.Not only this, but the software is terrible. I am currently using this mouse, a corsair keyboard, and a corsair AIO, the software has had a range of issues on and off. Sometimes my middle mouse wheel click won't function properly, but closing the software solves it, or the lights randomly go off and stay off on the AIO. The software has had various issues since I began using it after getting this mouse.I looked up the double click issue awhile ago, apparently Corsair has had this issue in other mice, and they continue to use the same manufacturer for the clicker despite all of the reported issues with it over the years. They seem to have no desire to resolve it.RECOMMENDATION: Stay away from Corsair peripherals. I know I will after this.EDIT UPDATE (not long after original review): So I contacted customer service, they were super helpful and sent me a replacement quickly and even allowed me to continue using the old mouse until I got it before sending the old one back. The process was virtually painless. I've been using the replacement for going on a year now without double clicking so far. I also did my research back then and found out many other common gaming mice brands have the same issue these days as many of them share the same OMRON switches that seem to have this issue more often. My research led me to mice that use other switches instead, but either those mice or those switches host their own issues.So, based on what you're looking for in a mouse, whether you need the extra features or not, another brand with another switch might be for you, if not, at least Corsair seems to have good customer service, so if it should start acting up on you, you'll be able to get a replacement.Because of my experience with customer service, and liking most of the other mouse features and ICUE software seeming to be better these days, I'll change my rating from 1 to 3.EDIT UPDATE (March 26th 2023):I'm adjusting my review to 4 stars. The replacement mouse I have been using now for almost 2 years without a single double clicking issue or other issues. I had a few mouse wheel abnormalities with the original mouse as well that I do not have with this one either. Perhaps I just got unlucky with a bad mouse the first time around, or perhaps I just got lucky with a good one this time around. I also have a backup that I purchased, unopened and unused from back when I got this replacement. I have yet to have need of it. Icou software has been running constantly on my computer for years now and I forget that it's there, which means it's been very good. The only time I should know it's there is when I want to use it to change something. I have ESC set on a mouse button and use it constantly, never had it fail.I will continue to update this over time, should I have any updates to make."}

This thing is absolutely perfect, comfortable and has more features than I will probably ever use or need.  The options in the Icue software are awesome, I can literally set the DPI to exactly what I want or need for what I'm doing at that moment and the DPI buttons make changing between profiles and 3 DPI settings per profile very easy.  So if you have larger hands and are looking for a comfortable mouse that also has amazing features, I don't think this one will disappoint."}

So I can give a pretty good review on it.  For gaming it works! fits my wide hand perfectly! It has a good response and switches(aside from the profile/dpi) work like a charm. that is where the star falls.  When you browse on the web or do typing or blogs you are going to be scrolling an aweful lot!  When you do your scroll wheel so too close to the profile \"switch\" button. often times I find my mouse switching to a lower DPI profile and at basline speed (lowest setting DPI) when you switch profile it goes to the lowest DPI setting after switch! this is not good when browsing as you often fatfinger the scrollwheel/profile switch button and wonder why your mouse suddenly crawls to a snail's pace. dangerous in some cases if you want to avoid pop up banner click bait. at the very least annoying. and NO it is not a malware! you not someone else has switched your profile(more than likely) by fat fingering the scrollwheel/profile switch. the button and the wheel are too close together!  Also Corsair could make it where your new profile switch stays on the same DPI level as your old. for instance if you are on level two it needs to stay on level two when you switch from Proflie A to Profile B and C and so on. Would partially fix the problem. another thing: the switch and wheel should have a larger gap for people with larger fingers. not all of us are piano players you know... Some people complain about the scrollwheel being cheap plastic(at least on the other Scimitar) this one is also. I cannot judge as I have not had it long enough to know when/if it could(or not) break.  It feels okay, just okay, not too flimsy not sturdy though either. same with the Scimitar which I also have. This Nightsword WASP FPS mouse feels less cheap and more sturdy than the Scimitar. why? Probably because the weights in it give it that illusion but it also feels less mushy in clicking L/R the hand grip rubber is better quality and it has flanks on the side for stablity.  I find it works for both FPS and RPG games and I don't play too many stratigy games anyway.  If you use it I recommend programming iCUE on another PC to hardware settings(LTD as they are) and then safely utilizing the mouse on a computer without iCue loaded(unless you have a lightening fast machine or play offline as I often do)  If you program settings you can reprogram it later as many times as you want as you change or play different games.  Also browsing and Icue is dangerous these days! Icue reputedly opens up backdoors to your firewall. I'd just use it for programming hardware and leave it off or use another computer to play games on without iCue loaded."}

As long as the work got done, they didn't care too much about what people did. Recently, they've dropped the hammer and have decided to start enforcing some new policies. One of those is that every team member must be active (green) in Microsoft Teams at all times. I work overnight, and that's not always possible since work slows down. There will be times that I have an hour between doing things, so most of my job is monitoring. I pass the time by reading or watching TV with my laptop open in front of me. I don't want to spend my shift just moving my mouse around on the screen to stay active, so I bought this little device.All I had to do was plug it in and it started working. It moves the cursor on the screen 1 pixel every second or so. It's so subtle that I don't even notice it when I'm working. It keeps my laptop awake, making it easier to monitor our systems without having to tap the mouse every 5 minutes, and it keeps my Teams status active so that my leadership team doesn't target me for inactivity.You would think at some point that managers would realize when they become strict or micromanage their employees that they're really just making their employees more sneaky and clever."}

I usually look through some of the best mice money can buy, then compare them with less expensive or no-name brands and see what the differences are.  Most of the time, it's just marketing jargons that pollutes the ad, making things seem better than they are.After some pretty extensive research, I purchased this Razer V3 Deathadder Pro and the Logitech G Pro Superlight gaming mouse - both of which stands at the very top of the food chain for gaming mice and are about the same price.  Both of these mice are used by professional gamers (depending on which sponsors they're with), and both are extremely light.  They both come in white with no RGB, and they also both taunt an outrageously high DPI that literally no one uses.  At a glance, both are very comparable in everyway - which I assume you know this if you're looking to buy a mouse this expensive.The Razer V3 DA Pro has much better optimizations in the Synapse software, and while some other reviewers have had issues, my windows 10 and 11 devices all run Synapse perfectly.  The mouse comes with a dongle that you can plug the wireless USB piece into, which allows for a better connection to the mouse when there is less space.  Even with RF, the signal deteriorates after the first foot or so.  As such, I leave my mouse and dongle fairly close to each other.  The Logitech software, however, is a total mess and I find it very difficult to navigate.  The software also crashes pretty often with Logitech, which has not been an issue with Razer Synapse.  Neither of these mice have a DPI button on top, but both allow for customization in the software.  The Razer DA V3P has a DPI button that allows you to cycle through the preset DPI options, which I'm glad they've put it on the bottom as I have only accidentally ever hit that on the other mice I use.  The Logitech does not have a DPI button at all, but you could configure the side buttons.  I use 800 DPI all around and never change it, so it does not affect me either way.I think for most people, ergonomics is what really determines the purchase but it's hard to describe ergonomics to someone who has never held either of these mice.  If you have used a Razer Deathadder V2, the previous version, you'll find that the V3 is a completely different feel and design - for the better, at least for me.  The Logitech is comfortable, but the Razer feels like an ergo mouse even though it isn't designed as one.Razer's advertising for this mouse is a little misleading.  The mouse has a standard polling rate of 1k hz, but with a 40 dollar adapter, you can get a 4k hz polling rate.  This is not an option at all with Logitech, as the mouse only has the 1k hz polling rate with no upgrades.Both mice have great skates to help with sliding, and in combination with the super lightweight, it feels even lighter than it is.  I did weigh both mice and found that the G Pro is about 5 grams lighter - this is not detectable by my hands when I'm using it.If battery life is important to you, I find both mouse lasts for quite some time even though I'm constantly using them.  Razer advertises a slightly longer battery life, and I find that to be mostly true.  What Razer doesn't advertise is their charging speeds, as it is in fact much faster than Logitech.  You can use either mouse while it's plugged in when they are charging.If you're getting the white variant of either mice, just know that the tape/grip comes only in black."}

The clicks were great and if you can get your hands on the 4k dongle, it has the best 4k performance on the market. But what didn't work for me was the coating. Razer's mice have the worst coating I have ever felt. It is a weird, almost \"chalky\" feeling that is just too slippery in my hands. I'm used to the GPX coating and it is great or even better Pulsar's latest releases or even the latest Lamzu release. Those companies have it figured out and dare I say come close to matching one of the best coatings, the xm1r from EGG.But with Razer it is the polar opposite, it just doesn't work for me at all and I can't get a grip on it. Just goes to show that regardless of the tech specs and even the shape, if something like the coating isn't great then it ruins the mouse. Now some might find it works good for them and that is fine, but it just didn't work for me.However, I have heard that the lastest Faker editon of this mouse has a different newer coating that isn't the same and is more in line with something I'm looking for. Might have to try that out myself sometime. Honestly, if you're someone who likes the coating of the GPX or any of the other mice I mentioned, go for the Faker edition instead."}

It cost less than $80, so I won't go into the value for the money at all with this review. That said, I got a perfect example for that cost.This mouse has been on my radar for a while. When I saw I could get it cheap, I had to pick it up. The feel in hand is fantastic for an ergo mouse. I prefer smaller mice, and I fingertip grip with my wrist anchored on my mousepad. With that grip, it makes contact with the pad right under my knuckles, which is where I like my mouse to give support. There's plenty of support for my ring and pinky finger as well, so they don't have to be tucked in or dragged on the mousepad. This mouse does feel large in the hand, but surprisingly light for its size. For reference, my main mouse is the Viper Mini Signature Edition. I still prefer the mini, but there's no denying that this mouse is comfortable.For palm grip, my fingers go a bit further on the mouse than I'd like, but it's still OK. Claw grip doesn't seem to work as well on this mouse for me as it does on ambi mice.The buttons are all great. I'm used to the Razer optical switches, and they feel well implemented on this mouse. The side buttons also are fantastic, without any wobble, pre, or post travel. The scroll wheel is a bit of a letdown though. It scrolls very easily, but without well defined stops, so you can easily accidentally scroll or over scroll. The scroll click is nice and light, but I find that I accidentally scroll when trying to click it.Build quality is solid. There no creaking or popping when exerting pressure on the mouse, no flex to speak of either. For what they're asking I'd expect this, but it's good that it lives up to it.If you can get a good deal on this mouse, I'd say go for it. Amazon's used mice have been a bit of a crap shoot for me. I got one that didn't have a receiver dongle, one that didn't have skates, and now this one, which is perfect. I'd say take the risk, you can always return it if you don't get what you're expecting!"}

I have large hands and this mouse is for large hands. Large hands meaning big width and long fingers. For example the Logitech g pro wireless I consider 'small' for myself. Take that into account.Razer is on absolute fire recently with their gaming mice department. I do not know if they got some type of freedom from their old product manager or got their own factory - who knows. All we know is they have been taking feedback and releasing exactly what the community is asking for and the products are FIRE.The Razer Deathadder v3 pro talks for itself, the biggest change for those who actually used the Deathadder is the mouse has reduced the flares on the left/right, and moved the hump more center instead of back. It is still ergonomic for sure but feels more similar to ambidextrous now. The best part is you can FULLY extend your ring finger comfortably across the right-side of the mouse. Your pinky has room as well and does not need to touch the mouse pad.The thumb buttons have been raised so your thumb has full extension access as well with zero contact to the thumb buttons. PERFECT. The mouse has great contact with the underside of your knuckle and some small contact with the palm.Besides the shape which is generally the most important part in deciding to buy a mouse the rest of the mouse is what I would call 'flawless'Sensor - Perfect tracking, zero sensor malfunction, zero jitter, zero +/- acceleration. (Side note, I have not tested 4000hz mode and while I am sure it is great I will be using it in 1000hz mode for longer battery life. I am older now and do not compete like I used to, 1000hz works perfectly fine for me).Coating (White version) - Absolutely wonderful, easy to grip, feels great in handMain clicks - Perfect, split trigger design, amazing actuation force feeling. No complaintsSide Buttons - Perfect, love the size and placement as wellScroll Wheel - It works, doesn't feel great, doesn't feel bad, feels good. I use it for jump in-game zero issuesWeight - Seriously. It's a large ergo mouse in the 63-64g range.. It's LIGHTBattery life - Haven't tested it yet but I am sure it's fine, running it in 1000hz mode.USB-C Connectivity - Great. Modern standards. Love itCable - They provided a lightweight usb-c cable for the receiver which is also used to charge the mouse, if you did have to run it in wired it is actually a great cable as well.Mouse Feet - Perfect glide zero issues on my endOverall for a large hand gaming who was seeking a wireless option. The Razer Deathadder v3 pro is the best thing I have ever graced my hands on. Tested it for several hours and after a quick muscle memory adjustment I was not only aiming fantastically (which I can do on several mice) but I was also comfortable. Comfort being the most important factor for me.The large size and lightweight also makes micro-tracking/adjustments even easier to do. I was using the G703 prior and it was do-able but fatigue hit sooner and it felt like a lot of effort sometimes to track something that was spinning around you (this is less an issue in tactical games like Counter-strike and Valorant, and more for fast paced games with a lot of tracking think Quake Live and Overwatch).The entire team that developed this product. I really wish I was in your industry - I would be absolutely proud to have released such a top-tier gaming product. The market of large hand competitive gamers were requesting this and it has been delivered. Beat both Logitech and Zowie to market which is incredible. Give yourself a pat on the back. I bought two of these one for daily and one for backup. Razer be proud, I truly feel like this is a, 'For Gamers, By Gamers' product.Amazing, 10/10 product for me. Love it. If you're a daily G703 user like I was, your upgrade is here. Zero-regret purchase."}

Started with the Quake games, Unreal Tournament, Team Fortress Classic, and Counter-Strike. I've tried many generations of mice. I eventually got the MX500 by Logitech, which was my first ergo mouse. I loved it! I followed that mouse shape for generations... MX510, MX518, 2 versions of G5, G500, (a bunch of different brand mice), G403, G703. I even modded my G703 to remove some weight and used custom switches. I also tried many other brands, Pwnage Ultra Custom Ergo, Mionix Castor, Zowie FK2, and some other Logitechs like G Pro Wireless and G203. There's a lot of other mice in there but I can't remember them all.The point is this DeathAdder V3 Pro is the best wireless ergo mouse on the market, BY FAR. It is very different feeling than previous Razer mice, but what they've arrived at with this design is excellent. The default skates feel fantastic. Clicks feel solid. Mouse wheel feels solid. Side buttons feel the right amount of responsive but not stiff. The weight... the weight is PERFECT in my opinion for control and feedback on your wrist/arm.Until Logitech makes some kind of Superlight G703, I don't think you can beat the DeathAdder V3 Pro for an ergo wireless mouse. Been using it to play games like Overwatch 2, Apex Legends, and I'll use it for the upcoming Counter-Strike 2. If you're on the fence about this mouse and you know you like ergo mice, just buy this. You'll enjoy it."}

First thing, the weight of this mouse is incredibly light.  It is really quite mind boggling.  Moving the mouse is so easy and the DPI means your mouse movements are very precise.  I'm running on 3200 DPI which I find perfect for my 1440p monitors.I had a Deathadder wired a long time ago.  Probably the first iteration.  This wireless mouse is a huge step ahead of that as well.I did some research on top gaming mice.  I saw the Razer Viper show up and this Deathadder was its alternative.  The only real difference being the Deathadder is shaped for right handers and slightly larger.  Being right-handed this was the easy choice and I'm glad I went with it.  I also don't have a large male hand probably average sized but I've found larger mice are more comfortable.  This mouse definitely is comfortable.  I also tend to not like gaming mice with many extra buttons.  The simple mouse 4 and 5 buttons being back and forward for browsers is perfect for me.I am very happy with my purchase and the white color is gorgeous.

When my opinions inevitably change, I will update the review. Edit: So far, I continue to really like the mouse. No new issues and it has replaced the Model D as my primary mouse.First, $150 is too much. You know it and I know it, but we buy it anyway, so they keep doing it. It is double the price of a Glorious Model D Wireless and it is not double the mouse. BUT let's move on to actually talking about the mouse.It's not the same shape as the old Deathadder. The flares are gone, it's overall skinnier, and the top is less flat. It's much closer to something like the Model D than the Deathadder at this point, though the Model D is still flatter on top. I kinda miss the flares, personally, as I could push my ring finger up against the right one for extra grip when lifting. This is much more of a hybrid grip kinda mouse whereas the old one was definitely a palm grip mouse. They also did away with the rubber grips (or any rubberized feeling at all), though they have included grip tape for people like myself who like it. Unfortunately, that tape is black, so if you get the white mouse, it's kinda ugly. Finally, the side buttons are moved slightly up and toward the back of the mouse, which I find better than the previous design.They shaved quite a lot of weight off the mouse and the result is that it sounds quite hollow. While I commend them for not putting holes in the mouse, the benefit of having holes is that sound doesn't bounce around inside the mouse, so it doesn't sound hollow. The main clicks are no longer part of the top shell but instead are separate pieces of plastic. I imagine this was done because the old ones felt like mushy crap. These feel great, though I imagine some people will find them a bit too heavy. I have a tendency to accidentally click, so these work for me. The middle click and side clicks all have a similar actuation force, so it's nice to have that consistency. Finally, the mouse wheel feels smoother than the old one when scrolling, closer to the Model D but still a little bit more distinct (which I like).The stock mouse feet are SLICK. I am not a competitive gamer, so I have never bothered to use any particularly fancy feet (though I did put the Tiger ICE on both the DA v2 Pro and the Viper Ultimate), but these are much slicker than I am used to. It feels almost like going from 800 to 900 or even 1000 DPI, I just don't feel as in control. However, over the course of a week or so, I have gotten used to them and for people who like that sort of thing in the first place, this will be a feature rather than a bug. Just something to be aware of.Finally, they removed RGB, Bluetooth, and charging dock capabilities. While I do like RGB, I didn't like that it required Synapse to work properly, so it's a net win for me. I set up my profile and now I can just ignore Synapse forever, hooray! Bluetooth sucks for a mouse, really, so that's no real loss. And the charging dock... I never had issues with it on the DA v2 Pro, but it was a bit more finnicky with the Viper Ultimate, perhaps because of the lighter weight. The tradeoff is that it now uses USB-C AND the opening is wide enough to accommodate the magnetic charging cable I've been using (the old designs were not), so I haven't really lost anything there.So, to summarize. Should you buy this mouse? It's a solid ergo shape, it's light, the clicks feel good, it has low latency, it's immune to double-clicking issues, it has one of the best sensors on the market, it basically doesn't need Synapse for anything, and it's overall just a really good mouse. But it's also $150 and that makes it very hard to recommend. But if you can hold out for a sale (or just have money to blow), absolutely get it."}

If you have used a Razer Deathadder V2, the previous version, you'll find that the V3 is a completely different feel and design - for the better, at least for me.  The Logitech is comfortable, but the Razer feels like an ergo mouse even though it isn't designed as one.Razer's advertising for this mouse is a little misleading.  The mouse has a standard polling rate of 1k hz, but with a 40 dollar adapter, you can get a 4k hz polling rate.  This is not an option at all with Logitech, as the mouse only has the 1k hz polling rate with no upgrades.Both mice have great skates to help with sliding, and in combination with the super lightweight, it feels even lighter than it is.  I did weigh both mice and found that the G Pro is about 5 grams lighter - this is not detectable by my hands when I'm using it.If battery life is important to you, I find both mouse lasts for quite some time even though I'm constantly using them.  Razer advertises a slightly longer battery life, and I find that to be mostly true.  What Razer doesn't advertise is their charging speeds, as it is in fact much faster than Logitech.  You can use either mouse while it's plugged in when they are charging.If you're getting the white variant of either mice, just know that the tape/grip comes only in black."}

The shape and performance are unmatched.And yet, I returned it as it wasn't for me. Don't get me wrong its a great mouse and perfect for larger handed players looking for a proper ergo mouse. The clicks were great and if you can get your hands on the 4k dongle, it has the best 4k performance on the market. But what didn't work for me was the coating. Razer's mice have the worst coating I have ever felt. It is a weird, almost \"chalky\" feeling that is just too slippery in my hands. I'm used to the GPX coating and it is great or even better Pulsar's latest releases or even the latest Lamzu release. Those companies have it figured out and dare I say come close to matching one of the best coatings, the xm1r from EGG.But with Razer it is the polar opposite, it just doesn't work for me at all and I can't get a grip on it. Just goes to show that regardless of the tech specs and even the shape, if something like the coating isn't great then it ruins the mouse. Now some might find it works good for them and that is fine, but it just didn't work for me.However, I have heard that the lastest Faker editon of this mouse has a different newer coating that isn't the same and is more in line with something I'm looking for. Might have to try that out myself sometime. Honestly, if you're someone who likes the coating of the GPX or any of the other mice I mentioned, go for the Faker edition instead."}

It cost less than $80, so I won't go into the value for the money at all with this review. That said, I got a perfect example for that cost.This mouse has been on my radar for a while. When I saw I could get it cheap, I had to pick it up. The feel in hand is fantastic for an ergo mouse. I prefer smaller mice, and I fingertip grip with my wrist anchored on my mousepad. With that grip, it makes contact with the pad right under my knuckles, which is where I like my mouse to give support. There's plenty of support for my ring and pinky finger as well, so they don't have to be tucked in or dragged on the mousepad. This mouse does feel large in the hand, but surprisingly light for its size. For reference, my main mouse is the Viper Mini Signature Edition. I still prefer the mini, but there's no denying that this mouse is comfortable.For palm grip, my fingers go a bit further on the mouse than I'd like, but it's still OK. Claw grip doesn't seem to work as well on this mouse for me as it does on ambi mice.The buttons are all great. I'm used to the Razer optical switches, and they feel well implemented on this mouse. The side buttons also are fantastic, without any wobble, pre, or post travel. The scroll wheel is a bit of a letdown though. It scrolls very easily, but without well defined stops, so you can easily accidentally scroll or over scroll. The scroll click is nice and light, but I find that I accidentally scroll when trying to click it.Build quality is solid. There no creaking or popping when exerting pressure on the mouse, no flex to speak of either. For what they're asking I'd expect this, but it's good that it lives up to it.If you can get a good deal on this mouse, I'd say go for it. Amazon's used mice have been a bit of a crap shoot for me. I got one that didn't have a receiver dongle, one that didn't have skates, and now this one, which is perfect. I'd say take the risk, you can always return it if you don't get what you're expecting!"}

I have large hands and this mouse is for large hands. Large hands meaning big width and long fingers. For example the Logitech g pro wireless I consider 'small' for myself. Take that into account.Razer is on absolute fire recently with their gaming mice department. I do not know if they got some type of freedom from their old product manager or got their own factory - who knows. All we know is they have been taking feedback and releasing exactly what the community is asking for and the products are FIRE.The Razer Deathadder v3 pro talks for itself, the biggest change for those who actually used the Deathadder is the mouse has reduced the flares on the left/right, and moved the hump more center instead of back. It is still ergonomic for sure but feels more similar to ambidextrous now. The best part is you can FULLY extend your ring finger comfortably across the right-side of the mouse. Your pinky has room as well and does not need to touch the mouse pad.The thumb buttons have been raised so your thumb has full extension access as well with zero contact to the thumb buttons. PERFECT. The mouse has great contact with the underside of your knuckle and some small contact with the palm.Besides the shape which is generally the most important part in deciding to buy a mouse the rest of the mouse is what I would call 'flawless'Sensor - Perfect tracking, zero sensor malfunction, zero jitter, zero +/- acceleration. (Side note, I have not tested 4000hz mode and while I am sure it is great I will be using it in 1000hz mode for longer battery life. I am older now and do not compete like I used to, 1000hz works perfectly fine for me).Coating (White version) - Absolutely wonderful, easy to grip, feels great in handMain clicks - Perfect, split trigger design, amazing actuation force feeling. No complaintsSide Buttons - Perfect, love the size and placement as wellScroll Wheel - It works, doesn't feel great, doesn't feel bad, feels good. I use it for jump in-game zero issuesWeight - Seriously. It's a large ergo mouse in the 63-64g range.. It's LIGHTBattery life - Haven't tested it yet but I am sure it's fine, running it in 1000hz mode.USB-C Connectivity - Great. Modern standards. Love itCable - They provided a lightweight usb-c cable for the receiver which is also used to charge the mouse, if you did have to run it in wired it is actually a great cable as well.Mouse Feet - Perfect glide zero issues on my endOverall for a large hand gaming who was seeking a wireless option. The Razer Deathadder v3 pro is the best thing I have ever graced my hands on. Tested it for several hours and after a quick muscle memory adjustment I was not only aiming fantastically (which I can do on several mice) but I was also comfortable. Comfort being the most important factor for me.The large size and lightweight also makes micro-tracking/adjustments even easier to do. I was using the G703 prior and it was do-able but fatigue hit sooner and it felt like a lot of effort sometimes to track something that was spinning around you (this is less an issue in tactical games like Counter-strike and Valorant, and more for fast paced games with a lot of tracking think Quake Live and Overwatch).The entire team that developed this product. I really wish I was in your industry - I would be absolutely proud to have released such a top-tier gaming product. The market of large hand competitive gamers were requesting this and it has been delivered. Beat both Logitech and Zowie to market which is incredible. Give yourself a pat on the back. I bought two of these one for daily and one for backup. Razer be proud, I truly feel like this is a, 'For Gamers, By Gamers' product.Amazing, 10/10 product for me. Love it. If you're a daily G703 user like I was, your upgrade is here. Zero-regret purchase."}

Started with the Quake games, Unreal Tournament, Team Fortress Classic, and Counter-Strike. I've tried many generations of mice. I eventually got the MX500 by Logitech, which was my first ergo mouse. I loved it! I followed that mouse shape for generations... MX510, MX518, 2 versions of G5, G500, (a bunch of different brand mice), G403, G703. I even modded my G703 to remove some weight and used custom switches. I also tried many other brands, Pwnage Ultra Custom Ergo, Mionix Castor, Zowie FK2, and some other Logitechs like G Pro Wireless and G203. There's a lot of other mice in there but I can't remember them all.The point is this DeathAdder V3 Pro is the best wireless ergo mouse on the market, BY FAR. It is very different feeling than previous Razer mice, but what they've arrived at with this design is excellent. The default skates feel fantastic. Clicks feel solid. Mouse wheel feels solid. Side buttons feel the right amount of responsive but not stiff. The weight... the weight is PERFECT in my opinion for control and feedback on your wrist/arm.Until Logitech makes some kind of Superlight G703, I don't think you can beat the DeathAdder V3 Pro for an ergo wireless mouse. Been using it to play games like Overwatch 2, Apex Legends, and I'll use it for the upcoming Counter-Strike 2. If you're on the fence about this mouse and you know you like ergo mice, just buy this. You'll enjoy it."}

First thing, the weight of this mouse is incredibly light.  It is really quite mind boggling.  Moving the mouse is so easy and the DPI means your mouse movements are very precise.  I'm running on 3200 DPI which I find perfect for my 1440p monitors.I had a Deathadder wired a long time ago.  Probably the first iteration.  This wireless mouse is a huge step ahead of that as well.I did some research on top gaming mice.  I saw the Razer Viper show up and this Deathadder was its alternative.  The only real difference being the Deathadder is shaped for right handers and slightly larger.  Being right-handed this was the easy choice and I'm glad I went with it.  I also don't have a large male hand probably average sized but I've found larger mice are more comfortable.  This mouse definitely is comfortable.  I also tend to not like gaming mice with many extra buttons.  The simple mouse 4 and 5 buttons being back and forward for browsers is perfect for me.I am very happy with my purchase and the white color is gorgeous.  I'm ready for my new PC build and I'm going Noir.  Good luck and happy gaming out there."}

{"asin": "B0B6Y52YXB", "username": "Nick", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat (but expensive) ergo mouse", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2022", "purchased": "Style: WirelessColor: White", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I just got the mouse today, but it looks like I'm one of the few people dumb enough to spend $150 on it, so I thought I'd give my impressions so far. When my opinions inevitably change, I will update the review. Edit: So far, I continue to really like the mouse. No new issues and it has replaced the Model D as my primary mouse.First, $150 is too much. You know it and I know it, but we buy it anyway, so they keep doing it. It is double the price of a Glorious Model D Wireless and it is not double the mouse. BUT let's move on to actually talking about the mouse.It's not the same shape as the old Deathadder. The flares are gone, it's overall skinnier, and the top is less flat. It's much closer to something like the Model D than the Deathadder at this point, though the Model D is still flatter on top. I kinda miss the flares, personally, as I could push my ring finger up against the right one for extra grip when lifting. This is much more of a hybrid grip kinda mouse whereas the old one was definitely a palm grip mouse. They also did away with the rubber grips (or any rubberized feeling at all), though they have included grip tape for people like myself who like it. Unfortunately, that tape is black, so if you get the white mouse, it's kinda ugly. Finally, the side buttons are moved slightly up and toward the back of the mouse, which I find better than the previous design.They shaved quite a lot of weight off the mouse and the result is that it sounds quite hollow. While I commend them for not putting holes in the mouse, the benefit of having holes is that sound doesn't bounce around inside the mouse, so it doesn't sound hollow. The main clicks are no longer part of the top shell but instead are separate pieces of plastic. I imagine this was done because the old ones felt like mushy crap. These feel great, though I imagine some people will find them a bit too heavy. I have a tendency to accidentally click, so these work for me. The middle click and side clicks all have a similar actuation force, so it's nice to have that consistency. Finally, the mouse wheel feels smoother than the old one when scrolling, closer to the Model D but still a little bit more distinct (which I like).The stock mouse feet are SLICK. I am not a competitive gamer, so I have never bothered to use any particularly fancy feet (though I did put the Tiger ICE on both the DA v2 Pro and the Viper Ultimate), but these are much slicker than I am used to. It feels almost like going from 800 to 900 or even 1000 DPI, I just don't feel as in control. However, over the course of a week or so, I have gotten used to them and for people who like that sort of thing in the first place, this will be a feature rather than a bug. Just something to be aware of.Finally, they removed RGB, Bluetooth, and charging dock capabilities. While I do like RGB, I didn't like that it required Synapse to work properly, so it's a net win for me. I set up my profile and now I can just ignore Synapse forever, hooray! Bluetooth sucks for a mouse, really, so that's no real loss. And the charging dock... I never had issues with it on the DA v2 Pro, but it was a bit more finnicky with the Viper Ultimate, perhaps because of the lighter weight. The tradeoff is that it now uses USB-C AND the opening is wide enough to accommodate the magnetic charging cable I've been using (the old designs were not), so I haven't really lost anything there.So, to summarize. Should you buy this mouse? It's a solid ergo shape, it's light, the clicks feel good, it has low latency, it's immune to double-clicking issues, it has one of the best sensors on the market, it basically doesn't need Synapse for anything, and it's overall just a really good mouse. But it's also $150 and that makes it very hard to recommend. But if you can hold out for a sale (or just have money to blow), absolutely get it."}

The only other mice that I've used that gave the same result was the g502 which lets be honest, is built like a brick. You can probably throw that thing against a wall and cause a sizable dent in it (the wall). Outside of maybe some finalmouse or even razer's own signature edition viper mini, this is the best mouse that you can buy on the market. Either this or the viper v2 pro, but that's down to preference. However, the price tag is an ouch. $150 MSRP is a hard asking price, but I feel like its more than fair at $120."}

I'm talking, I was literally going to consider surgery in 2 months, to now just needing to stretch my hand and take a break every now and then. This mouse costs basically save me from paying medical bills. I'm just baffled how a small and simple design can go from agony, tingling, burning in my hands to just playing carefree. Still more time to tell, but at this point after 5 straight days? I would have taken a 2 week break. Insanely awesome job by Razer. You have saved my favorite hobby!They somehow made a mice that is ergo and pro. First time I've played for hours pain free, while also playing better than ever.Any gamers experiencing wrist/hand pain, or want to prevent it, this mouse is it.Original Review:I've been on a wild chase for years trying to balance pain with gaming. I wear braces at night, standing desk, ergo chair, countless mice.. nothing worked. I work on a computer by day, and then do heavy competitive gaming on a low sensitivity... my Carpal tunnel, my thumb have just been screaming, and I've had to take days or weeks off, only to play for a few days and be right back where I started.I've been using the Razer Viper UItimate for 2 years now.. it's been an amazing mice but is absolutely horrible or your hands, or in my case, larger hands. Constantly squeezing the mouse causes so much strain over time. With the DA V3, the hump in the palm and the slight tilt makes an insane difference. It feels like my hands is just taking a huge sigh of relief when I place it on top of it. My thumb and ring/pinky used to having to death choke most mice, now just has to be presently holding the mouseI have NEVER had an 8 hour session on a game like Overwatch and had my hands/wrist feel GOOD the next day, until now. It does make you a bit more of a palm/relaxed claw grip, but coming from pure claw grip and pain, I just don't care. After tweaking dpi and sensitivity, my K/D in game has gone up 30-50%. I can just track enemies now, flicking I'm getting used to, as the micro mobility of switching claw to palm is taking practice. I easily got 39/6 K/D in Competitive last night.Overall:-Insanely light, feels like you are holding just a shell of a mouse.-Buttons are instant/clicky, best I've ever felt.-Zero latency issues, even moved fro 800 to 1600 dpi and halved my in-game sens to get the most out of the sensor.- IT WILL SAVE YOUR HANDS! I'm actually thinking of giving this mouse a go and seeing if I actually need Carpal Tunnel Surgery. I'll take spending 150 bucks over American Healthcare any day.-Grip tape, cable, dongle, all premiumJust an awesome mouse. I was so sad that clunky giant ergo mice like my Logitech vertical mouse was all I'd get.. but Razer actually somehow did it.If you are looking for a ergo mouse that is gaming friendly, this is it. Don't spend the hundreds of dollars and hours I did, this is the one. Measure your hands, and if you are medium-large, get this now."}

I believe both mice would be a better value and have a better feel if they included much more battery. I don't think 2-3 times the battery weight would be an issue in terms of accuracy.

Despite being 62 grams, I felt no creaking or squeaking when I proceeded to squeeze the mouse to test its durability. The only other mice that I've used that gave the same result was the g502 which lets be honest, is built like a brick. You can probably throw that thing against a wall and cause a sizable dent in it (the wall). Outside of maybe some finalmouse or even razer's own signature edition viper mini, this is the best mouse that you can buy on the market. Either this or the viper v2 pro, but that's down to preference. However, the price tag is an ouch. $150 MSRP is a hard asking price, but I feel like its more than fair at $120."}

Instantly helping with Carpal tunnel and my K/D", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2022", "purchased": "Style: WirelessColor: Black", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "5 Day Update: I have played HARD with this mouse, Worked all day on this mouse, and my pain is FADING! I'm talking, I was literally going to consider surgery in 2 months, to now just needing to stretch my hand and take a break every now and then. This mouse costs basically save me from paying medical bills. I'm just baffled how a small and simple design can go from agony, tingling, burning in my hands to just playing carefree. Still more time to tell, but at this point after 5 straight days? I would have taken a 2 week break. Insanely awesome job by Razer. You have saved my favorite hobby!They somehow made a mice that is ergo and pro. First time I've played for hours pain free, while also playing better than ever.Any gamers experiencing wrist/hand pain, or want to prevent it, this mouse is it.Original Review:I've been on a wild chase for years trying to balance pain with gaming. I wear braces at night, standing desk, ergo chair, countless mice.. nothing worked. I work on a computer by day, and then do heavy competitive gaming on a low sensitivity... my Carpal tunnel, my thumb have just been screaming, and I've had to take days or weeks off, only to play for a few days and be right back where I started.I've been using the Razer Viper UItimate for 2 years now.. it's been an amazing mice but is absolutely horrible or your hands, or in my case, larger hands. Constantly squeezing the mouse causes so much strain over time. With the DA V3, the hump in the palm and the slight tilt makes an insane difference. It feels like my hands is just taking a huge sigh of relief when I place it on top of it. My thumb and ring/pinky used to having to death choke most mice, now just has to be presently holding the mouseI have NEVER had an 8 hour session on a game like Overwatch and had my hands/wrist feel GOOD the next day, until now. It does make you a bit more of a palm/relaxed claw grip, but coming from pure claw grip and pain, I just don't care. After tweaking dpi and sensitivity, my K/D in game has gone up 30-50%. I can just track enemies now, flicking I'm getting used to, as the micro mobility of switching claw to palm is taking practice. I easily got 39/6 K/D in Competitive last night.Overall:-Insanely light, feels like you are holding just a shell of a mouse.-Buttons are instant/clicky, best I've ever felt.-Zero latency issues, even moved fro 800 to 1600 dpi and halved my in-game sens to get the most out of the sensor.- IT WILL SAVE YOUR HANDS! I'm actually thinking of giving this mouse a go and seeing if I actually need Carpal Tunnel Surgery. I'll take spending 150 bucks over American Healthcare any day.-Grip tape, cable, dongle, all premiumJust an awesome mouse. I was so sad that clunky giant ergo mice like my Logitech vertical mouse was all I'd get.. but Razer actually somehow did it.If you are looking for a ergo mouse that is gaming friendly, this is it. Don't spend the hundreds of dollars and hours I did, this is the one. Measure your hands, and if you are medium-large, get this now."}

In order to have smooth movement and something in your hand that has some solidity to it you need some weight. Also the slightest touch or bump will move the mouse a mile away. I believe both mice would be a better value and have a better feel if they included much more battery. I don't think 2-3 times the battery weight would be an issue in terms of accuracy. My biggest complaint with the Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse is that I have to charge it every other day. I am hoping I can get used to this mouse and I can get at lease a week between charges."}

{"asin": "B0885FJ8CB", "username": "Ryan", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed Review", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2021", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackSize: XXLStyle: Mat", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The Razer BlackWidow is one of the most iconic gaming keyboards of all time. It’s undergone numerous revisions over the years but today’s release marks new territory for the series with a new 65-percent compact form factor. If you found the ultra-compact Huntsman Mini too small but still like the idea of saving space on your desktop, this is a keyboard you won’t want to miss.If you’re coming from a full-size keyboard, expect a short learning curve. The V3 Mini doesn’t feature a function row and continues to hide less-used functions on secondary layers. This also applies to media controls and macros. To aid the learning curve, a number of the keys have side legends so you won’t need to guess what they do when pressed with Fn. These aren’t backlit, however, so you can’t see them in the dark.As a HyperSpeed product, the BlackWidow uses Razer’s latest wireless gaming technology to deliver wired-like performance without the need for a cord. This is the same tech found on some of the company’s premier wireless peripherals like the Orochi V2, one of our best gaming mice of 2021, and BlackWidow V3 Pro. Gone are the days of wireless peripherals lagging behind their wired counterparts. The BlackWidow V3 Mini was just as responsive whether it was connected over USB or with the 2.4GHz dongle.The new dongle has another trick up its sleeve: multi-device support. If you also happen to use a compatible Razer HyperSpeed mouse, you can pair it to the dongle inside Synapse and control both with a single USB port. This doesn’t apply to all HyperSpeed products yet (my Basilisk Ultimate wouldn’t work), but if you happen to own an Orochi V2, DeathAdder V2 Pro, or Naga Pro, you can store that dongle back in its compartment.Given its size and relatively steep price, you might want to take it on the go and the V3 Mini is ready to connect in any scenario. In addition to HyperSpeed wireless, it also features Bluetooth and wired USB support. Bluetooth has noticeably more latency than HyperSpeed or wired, so isn’t the ideal choice for gaming. Instead, I used it to quickly switch my laptop and desktop. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to use the bluetooth connection when charging, which is disappointing. I also wish there were a key combination to enter bluetooth mode instead of being forced to flip the switch on the back. First world problems, but when up and coming brands like Epomaker make swapping modes easier, it stands out.Despite multiple connection options, the V3 Mini sports an impressive battery life up to 200 hours. That’s a best case scenario with backlighting disabled and drops substantially depending on your lighting settings. Unlike some wireless keyboards, the Mini doesn’t cap the brightness of the backlight when wireless. At 100% brightness battery life drops all the way to 17 hours on spectrum cycling mode. Cut that brightness to 30% and it jumps back up to 48 hours. If you do happen to run dry, plugging in for 30 minutes will recharge the keyboard to 50% to get you back in the game quickly.Like the BlackWidow V3 Pro, the Mini HyperSpeed uses Razer’s doubleshot ABS keycaps (PBT is reserved for the Huntsman line) and your choice of clicky green or linear yellow Razer-branded switches. I was able to briefly test both versions but settled on the yellow switches. Razer’s new yellow switches feature internal dampers to cut down on key noise, so you won’t need to worry about bothering others around you. They’re also a speed switch. With an actuation force of 45 grams, they’re similar to Cherry MX Reds but trigger at 1.2mm instead of 2.0mm. That’s 40-percent faster and you can feel that sensitivity. My first day with the keyboard was frustratingly typo-filled until I got used to the lighter touch it requires.The keycaps are great and do an effective job of showing off the RGB. The legends are crisp and high-quality without the gamery feel and lettering gaps found on cheaper sets. They’re also much thicker than standard gaming keycaps and feel solid under the finger. Since they’re ABS, they will shine over time, but Razer has applied a light texture to their surface to ward off early wear and tear and to hide finger oils.Since this is a Razer gaming keyboard, you can look forward to all manner of programmability through its Synapse software. Of course, you have total control of the per-key RGB backlighting through a selection of good-looking presets or can customize or sync your own lighting animations through the Photoshop-esque Chroma Studio module. If you’d rather not use the software, the preset options are also stored on the keyboard’s memory, though avoiding Synapse will drastically reduce your customization options. No matter which you go with, it’s sure to be an eye-catching display of light and color thanks to the floating key design which exposes the translucent switch housings.The software also allows you to customize the layout of the keyboard with custom remaps, shortcuts, and macros. There are three onboard memory profiles to store settings for individual games, which is especially useful given the already compact layout. Creating your own keymaps is easy and intuitive thanks to key recording and an array of preset options for features like Windows shortcuts.Synapse has come a long way over the last several years and is well worth spending time with, but I still wish the BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed were not so dependent on it. For example, “on the fly” macro recording simply won’t work without it. Likewise, even though the keyboard is capable of producing 16 million colors, you can only choose between six for the three customizable presets built into the board. This simply pales in comparison to keyboards like the Ducky One 2 SF which has a similar form factor and doesn’t require software at all despite costing far less.Thanks to its small size and excellent connectivity, the BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed makes for an excellent travel keyboard. Over the course of my testing, I used it at work during the day and took it home for gaming at night. I had to send the clicky switch version back after two days, so the bulk of my testing was done using the Razer Yellow switches.Right off the bat, the Razer Yellow switches were a joy to type on. They’re smoother than Cherry MX Red, don’t have any spring noise, and feature internal sound damping to cut down on noise. They’re quiet enough to use in an office and softer to bottom out without feeling mushy. My first day was full of typos due to their increased sensitivity but by the time I got home to play games, I was used to the lighter touch they required. These are switches that will trigger simply from resting your fingers too heavily, but I found that actually taught me to bottom out less and made the keyboard even quieter to use.On the other hand, the larger keys were much louder than the rest due to poorly lubed stabilizers. Razer did apply a small amount but it wasn’t enough and there didn’t seem to be any in other places generating rattle, really defeating the purpose of the silenced switches on these keys. The backspace and spacebar were the worst offenders. I was able to fix this by adding some additional lube myself, but given how good the stabilizers have been on some of Razer’s other recent keyboards, and how expensive this board is, it really shouldn’t have been necessary.With both gaming and work, the 65-percent form factor was excellent. For navigating spreadsheets, word documents, and even browsing social media, the additional arrow and navigation keys were a godsend. 60-percent keyboards usually require advanced customization to make them fully and easily functional in these contexts. The Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini was easy to use, right out of the box, no programming required.Gaming with it was also easy and fun. Since it’s only one column wider than a 60-percent and roughly two columns narrower than a TKL, I was able to keep my hands closer together which made PC gaming more comfortable. Having the right-side keys double as macro buttons was also useful in World of Warcraft and let me keep my hands on the movement keys even when firing them off. Aesthetically, the smaller keyboard also fit right into with my PC gaming setup and looked clean due to the lack of wires.Dual-mode connectivity was useful but has room for improvement. I found myself switching between 2.4GHz and bluetooth regularly to work, game, or chat between my laptop and my desktop. Swapping connections is fast with only a couple seconds of delay but needing to flip a switch every time got old fast. HyperSpeed was reliably excellent no matter what game I was playing but bluetooth would occasionally feel sluggish with noticeable latency. Infrequently, it would miss keystrokes as if the connection had momentarily gone to sleep. It was usable but not something I wouldn’t attempt to game with."}

{"asin": "B0885FJ8CB", "username": "Ryan", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed Review", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2021", "purchased": "Color: Classic BlackSize: XXLStyle: Mat", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "The Razer BlackWidow is one of the most iconic gaming keyboards of all time. It’s undergone numerous revisions over the years but today’s release marks new territory for the series with a new 65-percent compact form factor. If you found the ultra-compact Huntsman Mini too small but still like the idea of saving space on your desktop, this is a keyboard you won’t want to miss.If you’re coming from a full-size keyboard, expect a short learning curve. The V3 Mini doesn’t feature a function row and continues to hide less-used functions on secondary layers. This also applies to media controls and macros. To aid the learning curve, a number of the keys have side legends so you won’t need to guess what they do when pressed with Fn. These aren’t backlit, however, so you can’t see them in the dark.As a HyperSpeed product, the BlackWidow uses Razer’s latest wireless gaming technology to deliver wired-like performance without the need for a cord. This is the same tech found on some of the company’s premier wireless peripherals like the Orochi V2, one of our best gaming mice of 2021, and BlackWidow V3 Pro. Gone are the days of wireless peripherals lagging behind their wired counterparts. The BlackWidow V3 Mini was just as responsive whether it was connected over USB or with the 2.4GHz dongle.The new dongle has another trick up its sleeve: multi-device support. If you also happen to use a compatible Razer HyperSpeed mouse, you can pair it to the dongle inside Synapse and control both with a single USB port. This doesn’t apply to all HyperSpeed products yet (my Basilisk Ultimate wouldn’t work), but if you happen to own an Orochi V2, DeathAdder V2 Pro, or Naga Pro, you can store that dongle back in its compartment.Given its size and relatively steep price, you might want to take it on the go and the V3 Mini is ready to connect in any scenario. In addition to HyperSpeed wireless, it also features Bluetooth and wired USB support. Bluetooth has noticeably more latency than HyperSpeed or wired, so isn’t the ideal choice for gaming. Instead, I used it to quickly switch my laptop and desktop. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to use the bluetooth connection when charging, which is disappointing. I also wish there were a key combination to enter bluetooth mode instead of being forced to flip the switch on the back. First world problems, but when up and coming brands like Epomaker make swapping modes easier, it stands out.Despite multiple connection options, the V3 Mini sports an impressive battery life up to 200 hours. That’s a best case scenario with backlighting disabled and drops substantially depending on your lighting settings. Unlike some wireless keyboards, the Mini doesn’t cap the brightness of the backlight when wireless. At 100% brightness battery life drops all the way to 17 hours on spectrum cycling mode. Cut that brightness to 30% and it jumps back up to 48 hours. If you do happen to run dry, plugging in for 30 minutes will recharge the keyboard to 50% to get you back in the game quickly.Like the BlackWidow V3 Pro, the Mini HyperSpeed uses Razer’s doubleshot ABS keycaps (PBT is reserved for the Huntsman line) and your choice of clicky green or linear yellow Razer-branded switches. I was able to briefly test both versions but settled on the yellow switches. Razer’s new yellow switches feature internal dampers to cut down on key noise, so you won’t need to worry about bothering others around you. They’re also a speed switch. With an actuation force of 45 grams, they’re similar to Cherry MX Reds but trigger at 1.2mm instead of 2.0mm. That’s 40-percent faster and you can feel that sensitivity. My first day with the keyboard was frustratingly typo-filled until I got used to the lighter touch it requires.The keycaps are great and do an effective job of showing off the RGB. The legends are crisp and high-quality without the gamery feel and lettering gaps found on cheaper sets. They’re also much thicker than standard gaming keycaps and feel solid under the finger. Since they’re ABS, they will shine over time, but Razer has applied a light texture to their surface to ward off early wear and tear and to hide finger oils.Since this is a Razer gaming keyboard, you can look forward to all manner of programmability through its Synapse software. Of course, you have total control of the per-key RGB backlighting through a selection of good-looking presets or can customize or sync your own lighting animations through the Photoshop-esque Chroma Studio module. If you’d rather not use the software, the preset options are also stored on the keyboard’s memory, though avoiding Synapse will drastically reduce your customization options. No matter which you go with, it’s sure to be an eye-catching display of light and color thanks to the floating key design which exposes the translucent switch housings.The software also allows you to customize the layout of the keyboard with custom remaps, shortcuts, and macros. There are three onboard memory profiles to store settings for individual games, which is especially useful given the already compact layout. Creating your own keymaps is easy and intuitive thanks to key recording and an array of preset options for features like Windows shortcuts.Synapse has come a long way over the last several years and is well worth spending time with, but I still wish the BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed were not so dependent on it. For example, “on the fly” macro recording simply won’t work without it. Likewise, even though the keyboard is capable of producing 16 million colors, you can only choose between six for the three customizable presets built into the board. This simply pales in comparison to keyboards like the Ducky One 2 SF which has a similar form factor and doesn’t require software at all despite costing far less.Thanks to its small size and excellent connectivity, the BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed makes for an excellent travel keyboard. Over the course of my testing, I used it at work during the day and took it home for gaming at night. I had to send the clicky switch version back after two days, so the bulk of my testing was done using the Razer Yellow switches.Right off the bat, the Razer Yellow switches were a joy to type on. They’re smoother than Cherry MX Red, don’t have any spring noise, and feature internal sound damping to cut down on noise. They’re quiet enough to use in an office and softer to bottom out without feeling mushy. My first day was full of typos due to their increased sensitivity but by the time I got home to play games, I was used to the lighter touch they required. These are switches that will trigger simply from resting your fingers too heavily, but I found that actually taught me to bottom out less and made the keyboard even quieter to use.On the other hand, the larger keys were much louder than the rest due to poorly lubed stabilizers. Razer did apply a small amount but it wasn’t enough and there didn’t seem to be any in other places generating rattle, really defeating the purpose of the silenced switches on these keys. The backspace and spacebar were the worst offenders. I was able to fix this by adding some additional lube myself, but given how good the stabilizers have been on some of Razer’s other recent keyboards, and how expensive this board is, it really shouldn’t have been necessary.With both gaming and work, the 65-percent form factor was excellent.

I like that it has a thumb rest and small movements could be made quickly and accurately.  I have a US mens size 8 hand, and use the claw grip.  Every once in a while the sniper button is handy, but I never use the other 2 side buttons.I hated having to configure the thing on WinBlows, then using the \"profile\" button to change mouse modes on Linux.  Now openrazer and Polychromatic work well on Linux with the v1, v2 and v3 models.  No need for the \"profile\" button, but I do use the two little buttons below the scroll wheel to change sensitivity now and again.The v2 added left/right tilt on the scroll wheel, and a manual friction adjustment on the scroll wheel.  I never use the tilt, but getting the scroll wheel friction just right is very nice.Then I bought this v3.  One step forward, one step back.  The friction adjustment is gone, and 3 months later I still miss it.  I now use the \"smart wheel\" mode, and 3 months later it still surprises me.  I can sort of predict when the wheel friction will go away and infinite scroll mode starts.  After a bit, the scroll wheel friction comes back with a little click, but the infinite scroll mode stays on.  If I move the mouse to another window then, the window will also infinite scroll, and that is never what I want.  Some indeterminate time later, the infinite scroll turns off, with no indication that has happened.The infinite scroll mode is really useful for many web pages, but too hard to use most of the time.Given the choice, I might buy a v2 instead of the v3 next time.  I hope for a v4 which fixes the problems with the new free scroll mode."}

My only real complaint is the design of the scroll wheel, which I just do not understand. It worked well for about a year and a half, but around the 18-month mark the wheel started \"slipping\". It wasn't like a problem with the sensors(as the razer website will tell you), it was almost like the rubber grip was sliding without turning the wheel. It didn't happen all the time, just on occasion I'd miss a few clicks when scrolling. Not a problem for browsing the internet, a bit of a problem for gaming. When I went to try to figure out what was wrong, I realized that the rubber grip on the wheel is literally just a ring of rubber, completely smooth and flat on the bottom. It's just sitting on a band of smooth metal. The metal is completely clean, as is the underside of the rubber, leading me to believe that there wasn't even any adhesive. They just put a smooth rubber band on smooth metal and.... hoped for the best? I just don't get it. I guess the friction from how tight the band was worked for a bit, but obviously, with time, the rubber has relaxed slightly. It doesn't take much for smooth rubber to slip on smooth metal. I mean, I can't be that mad because it was a fairly cheap mouse that's been pretty high quality, I just don't get why a bit of adhesive or a rough surface was not considered. Seems like a huge oversight, and not an especially expensive design change."}

{"asin": "B0916MW7CG", "username": "Nick Ellingson", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nLightweight Fingertip Grip, But Double Click Issues", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023", "purchased": "Color: Classic Black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "First some context for how I use this mouse. I do about an hour of aim training every day, and then anywhere from 0-8 hours of FPS gaming per day. Average of probably 2 hours of gaming per day. I have a relaxed fingertip grip, my fingertips usually rest about 1/3 of the way down from the tip of the mouse. This means I usually end up clicking near the back part of the mouse buttons. I also have pretty small hands for my height.The first thing I noticed about this mouse is how dang light it is. It comes with a 15gram AA battery to use with it. There is also a slot for a AAA battery if you want, however that slot is farther back and makes the mouse feel less centered. You can buy adaptors (usually about 3 grams) to fit a AAA lithium battery (usually about 7 grams)  into the AA slot if you want, and this would shave about 5 grams off of the weight while still keeping it feeling balanced. I hadn't bought a new mouse for about 5 years, so my old G403 felt like a sack of potatoes compared to using this thing. The mouse skates are also great, nice and wide and completely pure white teflon.The second thing I noticed was the shape. It's obviously a small mouse, and I'm fine with that, but I found that I really disliked the taper on the back of the mouse. Since I have a gripstyle that sits pretty far back on the mouse, I really noticed the lack of control that my pinky now had - I had to curl my pinky in a bit. On my G403, there is a small hump back there that really helped my pinky contribute to my aim. Similarly, it felt like my thumb was contributing slightly less to my aim, although not quite to the same effect as my pinky.Everything mechanically felt great, clicks feel good and the thumb buttons feel good as well. I like the size of the thumb buttons, I wish more people made them \"thin\" like they are on the Orochi. I barely use the scroll wheel due to the nature of the games I play, so I can't speak to that part of the mouse.In my aim training, I noticed some immediate differences. Tracking was SOOOO much easier. My tracking scores in Kovaak's literally immediately jumped up. This isn't too surprising considering that the Orochi is about 50 grams lighter than my previous mouse was (G403). However, I also had an immediate dip in my static scores. There simply is no stopping power in this mouse, and I had grown used to my G403 having a bit of friction due to weight. This is something that I adapted to over time, and I eventually ended up beating my static high scores with the Orochi after a few weeks.The coating is not great. Or really just the lack of a coating. It's like a textured ABS plastic or something, it's certainly not the most slippery thing in the world, but I would often have to re-adjust my grip after about 15 seconds of very fast tracking that covers large swaths of area. There are grip pads you can use to help with this, but personally I'd rather deal with a mild amount of slipperiness than to put a stick-on grip pad onto my mouse. I found that my grip actually ended up changing mildly because of this, my ring finger ended up resting on the right \"edge\" of the mouse between the top and the side. This allowed it to have a \"hard\" edge to grab onto.The DPI button is nicely recessed, so I never had any issues with accidentally clicking it like I've had on other mice. It's still usable if you wanted to do a DPI shift mid game for certain games where that can be advantageous.Never had a single issue with connectivity, but I also keep my mouse dongle in a spot where it should have a great connection to the mouse. The battery life is kind of insane, after 3 months of almost constant use, it still has a nearly full battery. I never really used the mouse in Bluetooth mode, so I can't speak to how that functions.Now with all of the bases covered, time for the biggest issue I had with this mouse: double clicking. My index finger rests to the far right of the left click, almost touching the scroll wheel. After about 3 months of use, I noticed that while holding down left click during tracking scenarios, I would occasionally miss a \"beat\" of the left click being held down. I thought it was user error, but it kept happening once in a blue moon. The click would be held down, and there would be no mechanical feedback of the click being let go or \"reclicked\", but it would still blip out for a bit. Then, after a little bit of this, I started to have a much larger issue - I was getting the occasional double click. Again, I thought this might be user error, but there were a couple of situations that made it extremely obvious to me. One such scenario was in Overwatch, where I shot someone as Cassidy and then instantly started channeling my ultimate, but the ultimate instantly got \"used\" despite me not clicking again. I also noticed it while playing Bloons TD6, where I accidentally bought two upgrades instead of a single one for one of my towers. I started looking into it and used a \"double click test\" that I found online that shows the latency between clicks, and I found that I could somewhat consistently (about once every 10 tries) replicate the double click situation. You can see this in the picture that I have attached, where I am clicking about every 0.8 seconds, but once there is a second click at about .28 seconds. It seems to be something with the release of the click, like if I click but *EXTREMELY SLIGHTLY* ease the pressure mid-click, the click is still being held down mechanically, but the mouse almost seems to interpret that the click was quickly let go and then re-clicked.I haven't had any issues with the right click. I also didn't have the double-click issue for several months, or if I did it was rare enough that I never noticed it.TLDR: The mouse is extremely light, feels good, slightly awkward shape, is a little slippery, insane battery life, and works well, except mine had a double click issue. If yours doesn't have the same issue, then I would recommend it for fingertip or claw grip."}

I have 17cm hands, and this mouse fits like a glove, its great, go get it.  Its not perfect, Razer cheaped out and went with a prior gen sensor, and DPI scaling is only in hundreds.  Middle click is a bit too heavy, but I love the tactile scroll wheel.The shape of this mouse is perfect for small to lower end medium hands, I can claw, finger, and palm without any discomfort.  It looks kinda like an egg shape from the top, but it has a really deep ergonomic comfort indent under the side buttons giving you a really secure grip, I feel confident with it, granted I felt confident with my Model O-, but this shape and size suits me much more.  The mouse is also balanced when it comes to wobble, as in there is no wobble.  Every mouse i've used prior to this, even if minimal, has had some wobble.The button clicks are crispier, and more deliberate than the standard Omron switches on most other mice.  I think its just preference, but I like it a bit heavier like this.  Its not night and day heavy and you probably wouldn't even notice unless comparing, but it is.  Side buttons are always mediocre, but these side buttons don't feel like an afterthought, they are clicky and fast.  Scroll wheel is on the heavier tactile side, which is my preference, feels money.  Mouse click is a bit heavy, wouldn't use it for anything you need speed for.It is heavier than other mice i've used, but not by much.  I use this mouse in its AA configuration with the included battery because it feels better balanced than the AAA slot.  A AAA battery makes this mouse feel back heavy and less wieldy than with the AA battery, which feels 'lighter' because the weight is more consistent.  You could get a converter but I think the 75g total weight to feel fine, it doesn't detract from my aim or comfort.The mouse skates are amazingly smooth and thick, they feel better than the tiger arc 2's I have on another mouse.  They have this kind of incandescent shimmer to them on the bottom and look unique, but damn do they feel good.  It is unfortunate when they wear out I wont be able to buy official orochi v2 skates, because for some reason Razer believes you should buy a new mouse.  Corepads and Tiger are good companies, they make good products, but these just feel so good, its such a damn shame.  I play on a glass mousepad, so these feet will eventually wear out, even if it'll take a bit.The sensor is, well its a modern sensor with zero noticeable issues.  That said due to sensor position the DPI in settings is not accurate.  If you game at 400 dpi you're going to have to get used to the additional speed unless you want the potential pixel skipping and slower Y axis at 300 dpi.  I got used to it, but it would of been better if we could adjust DPI at least by 50, if not by 1.  If you use 1600 DPI, you can just lower it to 1500 without any issue since anything over 800 is already pretty damn smooth.  I would of given it a demerit for this since a good configuration software can fix anything, but it didn't affect me at the end of the day.  If you are OCD about it, this mouse will drive you crazy.  If they release an Orochi V3 I hope they use their better sensor, battery life is not as important.  Mouse lift off is a bit higher than 1mm even if you adjust it to that in settings.It is a modern wireless mouse, as all modern wireless mice it has zero problems with latency or skipping.  Some people have had issues though, which appear to be fixed with a beta firmware update that you can get on Reddit.  I cant fault the mouse since the problem never happened to me, but YMMV.Before getting this mouse I swore I would never get a razer product again, the feet for my Razer Naga Trinity has worn out and I was unable to get replacements since no one made them, and razer did not sell them from their store.  Unfortunately, they seem to be continuing this trend, but the big players will make their own feet for it so they've got you covered."}

I gamed for decades and always had the best mice.  But, the last year few years I haven't gamed much and had been using something not so great.  I play a game here or there again and decided I wanted something great again.  I want a mouse that will last many years (something that you have to put batteries into / not rechargeable), that is fairly small and light (which I've always preferred), has no fancy lights, long battery life, responsive & accurate, and good quality / feel.This clicks all the boxes!  It allows you to use a AA or a AAA; only one at a time, do not insert both.  The AAA option is for the lightest weight.  I admit I haven't used that option.  I want the longevity of the AA over the AAA (usually rechargeable AAA's are under 1000mah, and AA's are over 2000mah - so you get 2 to 3 times more battery life with the AA).  I use rechargeable batteries in everything; however, the first battery I used in this mouse is an Energizer lithium.  I want to see how long it lasts with a normal high quality battery (so far, 30 days with ~7  hours of computer use a day.  I never turn the mouse off, it is always switched to 2.4 and turned on when I am away from computer).  With the AA the feel and balance is great.  One of best feeling mice I have used.  Has plenty of buttons for my uses.  Extreme gamers may want more.  I barely use the few extra it has.  The buttons all feel good and sturdy.  They should last, I hope.  It looks classy, I have the white color.I like that is has both bluetooth and 2.4 modes.  The 2.4 mode will give you the best performance.  However, it will also cut the battery life!  The bluetooth mode will give you a ton more battery life; however, you will lack some performance.  I have not tested bluetooth mode at all yet, I wanted to test the mouse fully with this first battery before doing that.  In the future, I may switch between bluetooth mode and 2.4 mode when I switch from normal computing to gaming.  I only game say, 1 out of 7 hours I am on the computer.  So, that is a potential benefit.  I also like it has the bluetooth in case I want to take it anywhere for work computing, with a laptop or tablet.  Then, I can leave the 2.4 usb card in my desktop at home, and still have a great mouse for on the go.  When I bring it home, it's all ready again.Overall I am very happy with it after having it for a month now and using it daily.  I hope it lasts for years.*Update.  My mouse battery finally died for the first time on March 27, 2022.  It was working perfect, then suddenly the cursor stopped moving.  It lasted about 2.5 months with an Energizer Lithium (2.4ghz whole time, mouse never turned off).  Not bad!  I assume a good rechargeable (Eneloop) will give me at least 2 months (and with rechargeable batteries, I will just replace every 2 months (maybe even every month), just so I know my mouse will never stop working when I need it))."}

I've used the G502 for over 4 years and the weight doesn't really bother me in game, but lately it's been hurting my right hand so I wanted something more light. First I ordered Logitech G305, it was on sale for $30, after countless reviews on Youtube and Google I cancelled the G305 and ordered the  Orochi V2 instead.All of the reviews will tell you the Orochi V2 is a superior product in everyway. The only problem was the Orochi V2 was $70 and G305 was $50 (but occasionally on sale for lower). Now that price drop because of the holidays the Orochi V2 is the BEST option for a budget wireless mouse period. It compete with a lot of the higher end mouse on the market that ranges b/w $100-$150.My hand size is in b/w medium and large and the Orochi V2 fit it perfectly. I was a little worry that it might be too small for my hand after looking at several reviews but this wasn't the case. The back of mouse sit perfectly on my palm and my fingers are perfectly place on the tip of the mouse. When I place my hand on the mouse it felt like it was perfectly cater to my hand in a natural shape. For example, if you was to relax your hand and just let it naturally curl then place that hand the Orochi V2 it would fit perfectly without needing to adjust or move any fingers (at least for me). I used a AAA Lithium battery and place it on the AA slot for better balance and lighter weight. Coming from the G502 (121 gram) to the Orochi V2 (65 gram) there's no resistance at all when moving left and right and it felt natural compare to the heavier mouse.This is my first wireless gaming mouse and I don't usually care about the technical stuff but something about this click on the mouse feel very satisfying even the side buttons. All around feel great... I only wish they have infinite scroll/hyper scroll like the G502. When I first bought the G502 I hated the scroll wheels but I've learned to love it so much especially browsing the web or reading an online novel. The scroll wheel on the Orochi V2 is also good but I just prefer the infinite/hyper scroll since I'm so used to it.Anyways, I've used it only for a few days and right hand feels a lot better. The numb/pain is going away after using the Orochi V2, I think it'll take a week or two before it's fully back to normal.I'm using a USB 3.1 on the mouse so far no problem with skipping but there is a firmware update that suppose to fix skipping issues if you're currently experiencing that. The firmware can only be updated using a Bluetooth connection so beware. In conclusion this mouse is worth $45 and even more with the build quality and comfort it provide. After experiencing what 65g of weight feels like I don't think I can go back to a heaver mouse or wired."}
{"asin": "B0916MW7CG", "username": "Nick Ellingson", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nLightweight Fingertip Grip, But Double Click Issues", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023", "purchased": "Color: Classic Black", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "First some context for how I use this mouse. I do about an hour of aim training every day, and then anywhere from 0-8 hours of FPS gaming per day. Average of probably 2 hours of gaming per day. I have a relaxed fingertip grip, my fingertips usually rest about 1/3 of the way down from the tip of the mouse. This means I usually end up clicking near the back part of the mouse buttons. I also have pretty small hands for my height.The first thing I noticed about this mouse is how dang light it is. It comes with a 15gram AA battery to use with it. There is also a slot for a AAA battery if you want, however that slot is farther back and makes the mouse feel less centered. You can buy adaptors (usually about 3 grams) to fit a AAA lithium battery (usually about 7 grams)  into the AA slot if you want, and this would shave about 5 grams off of the weight while still keeping it feeling balanced. I hadn't bought a new mouse for about 5 years, so my old G403 felt like a sack of potatoes compared to using this thing. The mouse skates are also great, nice and wide and completely pure white teflon.The second thing I noticed was the shape. It's obviously a small mouse, and I'm fine with that, but I found that I really disliked the taper on the back of the mouse. Since I have a gripstyle that sits pretty far back on the mouse, I really noticed the lack of control that my pinky now had - I had to curl my pinky in a bit. On my G403, there is a small hump back there that really helped my pinky contribute to my aim. Similarly, it felt like my thumb was contributing slightly less to my aim, although not quite to the same effect as my pinky.Everything mechanically felt great, clicks feel good and the thumb buttons feel good as well. I like the size of the thumb buttons, I wish more people made them \"thin\" like they are on the Orochi. I barely use the scroll wheel due to the nature of the games I play, so I can't speak to that part of the mouse.In my aim training, I noticed some immediate differences. Tracking was SOOOO much easier. My tracking scores in Kovaak's literally immediately jumped up. This isn't too surprising considering that the Orochi is about 50 grams lighter than my previous mouse was (G403). However, I also had an immediate dip in my static scores. There simply is no stopping power in this mouse, and I had grown used to my G403 having a bit of friction due to weight. This is something that I adapted to over time, and I eventually ended up beating my static high scores with the Orochi after a few weeks.The coating is not great. Or really just the lack of a coating. It's like a textured ABS plastic or something, it's certainly not the most slippery thing in the world, but I would often have to re-adjust my grip after about 15 seconds of very fast tracking that covers large swaths of area. There are grip pads you can use to help with this, but personally I'd rather deal with a mild amount of slipperiness than to put a stick-on grip pad onto my mouse. I found that my grip actually ended up changing mildly because of this, my ring finger ended up resting on the right \"edge\" of the mouse between the top and the side. This allowed it to have a \"hard\" edge to grab onto.The DPI button is nicely recessed, so I never had any issues with accidentally clicking it like I've had on other mice. It's still usable if you wanted to do a DPI shift mid game for certain games where that can be advantageous.Never had a single issue with connectivity, but I also keep my mouse dongle in a spot where it should have a great connection to the mouse. The battery life is kind of insane, after 3 months of almost constant use, it still has a nearly full battery. I never really used the mouse in Bluetooth mode, so I can't speak to how that functions.Now with all of the bases covered, time for the biggest issue I had with this mouse: double clicking. My index finger rests to the far right of the left click, almost touching the scroll wheel. After about 3 months of use, I noticed that while holding down left click during tracking scenarios, I would occasionally miss a \"beat\" of the left click being held down. I thought it was user error, but it kept happening once in a blue moon. The click would be held down, and there would be no mechanical feedback of the click being let go or \"reclicked\", but it would still blip out for a bit. Then, after a little bit of this, I started to have a much larger issue - I was getting the occasional double click. Again, I thought this might be user error, but there were a couple of situations that made it extremely obvious to me. One such scenario was in Overwatch, where I shot someone as Cassidy and then instantly started channeling my ultimate, but the ultimate instantly got \"used\" despite me not clicking again. I also noticed it while playing Bloons TD6, where I accidentally bought two upgrades instead of a single one for one of my towers. I started looking into it and used a \"double click test\" that I found online that shows the latency between clicks, and I found that I could somewhat consistently (about once every 10 tries) replicate the double click situation. You can see this in the picture that I have attached, where I am clicking about every 0.8 seconds, but once there is a second click at about .28 seconds. It seems to be something with the release of the click, like if I click but *EXTREMELY SLIGHTLY* ease the pressure mid-click, the click is still being held down mechanically, but the mouse almost seems to interpret that the click was quickly let go and then re-clicked.I haven't had any issues with the right click. I also didn't have the double-click issue for several months, or if I did it was rare enough that I never noticed it.TLDR: The mouse is extremely light, feels good, slightly awkward shape, is a little slippery, insane battery life, and works well, except mine had a double click issue. If yours doesn't have the same issue, then I would recommend it for fingertip or claw grip."}

Has plenty of buttons for my uses.  Extreme gamers may want more.  I barely use the few extra it has.  The buttons all feel good and sturdy.  They should last, I hope.  It looks classy, I have the white color.I like that is has both bluetooth and 2.4 modes.  The 2.4 mode will give you the best performance.  However, it will also cut the battery life!  The bluetooth mode will give you a ton more battery life; however, you will lack some performance.  I have not tested bluetooth mode at all yet, I wanted to test the mouse fully with this first battery before doing that.  In the future, I may switch between bluetooth mode and 2.4 mode when I switch from normal computing to gaming.  I only game say, 1 out of 7 hours I am on the computer.  So, that is a potential benefit.  I also like it has the bluetooth in case I want to take it anywhere for work computing, with a laptop or tablet.  Then, I can leave the 2.4 usb card in my desktop at home, and still have a great mouse for on the go.  When I bring it home, it's all ready again.Overall I am very happy with it after having it for a month now and using it daily.  I hope it lasts for years.*Update.  My mouse battery finally died for the first time on March 27, 2022.  It was working perfect, then suddenly the cursor stopped moving.  It lasted about 2.5 months with an Energizer Lithium (2.4ghz whole time, mouse never turned off).  Not bad!  I assume a good rechargeable (Eneloop) will give me at least 2 months (and with rechargeable batteries, I will just replace every 2 months (maybe even every month), just so I know my mouse will never stop working when I need it))."}

I've used the G502 for over 4 years and the weight doesn't really bother me in game, but lately it's been hurting my right hand so I wanted something more light. First I ordered Logitech G305, it was on sale for $30, after countless reviews on Youtube and Google I cancelled the G305 and ordered the  Orochi V2 instead.All of the reviews will tell you the Orochi V2 is a superior product in everyway. The only problem was the Orochi V2 was $70 and G305 was $50 (but occasionally on sale for lower). Now that price drop because of the holidays the Orochi V2 is the BEST option for a budget wireless mouse period. It compete with a lot of the higher end mouse on the market that ranges b/w $100-$150.My hand size is in b/w medium and large and the Orochi V2 fit it perfectly. I was a little worry that it might be too small for my hand after looking at several reviews but this wasn't the case. The back of mouse sit perfectly on my palm and my fingers are perfectly place on the tip of the mouse. When I place my hand on the mouse it felt like it was perfectly cater to my hand in a natural shape. For example, if you was to relax your hand and just let it naturally curl then place that hand the Orochi V2 it would fit perfectly without needing to adjust or move any fingers (at least for me). I used a AAA Lithium battery and place it on the AA slot for better balance and lighter weight. Coming from the G502 (121 gram) to the Orochi V2 (65 gram) there's no resistance at all when moving left and right and it felt natural compare to the heavier mouse.This is my first wireless gaming mouse and I don't usually care about the technical stuff but something about this click on the mouse feel very satisfying even the side buttons. All around feel great... I only wish they have infinite scroll/hyper scroll like the G502. When I first bought the G502 I hated the scroll wheels but I've learned to love it so much especially browsing the web or reading an online novel. The scroll wheel on the Orochi V2 is also good but I just prefer the infinite/hyper scroll since I'm so used to it.Anyways, I've used it only for a few days and right hand feels a lot better. The numb/pain is going away after using the Orochi V2, I think it'll take a week or two before it's fully back to normal.I'm using a USB 3.1 on the mouse so far no problem with skipping but there is a firmware update that suppose to fix skipping issues if you're currently experiencing that. The firmware can only be updated using a Bluetooth connection so beware. In conclusion this mouse is worth $45 and even more with the build quality and comfort it provide. After experiencing what 65g of weight feels like I don't think I can go back to a heaver mouse or wired."}

The weight of the previous generation helped balance its small size and provide a more solid, intentional feeling during quick movements and actions. Additionally, the body is entirely plastic, while V1 felt to be a combination of plastic and aluminum. Maybe I owned a special top cover, but the added weight and heft of the materials made V1 feel like a more solid, long-lasting piece of hardware. I am honestly disappointed with how cheap and plastic it feels.Pro: The body style is very similar to V1.Con: The body style is different enough from V1 that my hands and eyes notice. The surface is pitted and textured like more common budget mice. V1's surface texture was matte, slick, and without a strong texture. The missing hard lines on the body provide less resting places for my fingers.Pro: the DPI switches (like its predecessor) can be custom mapped to another button so they aren't in your way.Con: The mouse only has two programmable buttons within quick reach of a right-hand user. There are no left-handed thumb-adjacent programmable buttons. An additional, programmable button is available behind the scroll wheel, but its placement makes it impractical for anything other than a DPI switch for me personally.Pro: The 2.5ghz and bluetooth connectivity options are not only convenient, but extremely quick and reliable. The 2.5ghz dongle is hidden within the battery compartment and easy to keep track of. The lack of a wired connection option means I don't have to hunt down a proprietary, strangely-shaped cable (from the V1) to play my games.Con: The inability to choose a wired connection makes this a MASSIVE feature loss compared to V1.Pro: Battery life is incredible. Battery percentage will display within Windows 10 when connected via bluetooth. Have not yet tested to see if that's true on MacOS systems, but it typically is.Con: V2 did not come with a rechargable feature. V1 did not either. This was a missed opportunity for Razer, but may have been a deliberate choice to keep V2 at a reduced weight.Pro: The lack of RGB lighting increases overall battery life over the V1.Con: V1's scroll wheel RGB was pleasant. I would trade battery life for RGB, but I can live without it.I love this mouse, but I find myself rejecting it because of the variances with the V1 I came from. The V1 Orochi was my daily mouse for nearly 12 years and I sure miss it."}

Good RGB, Program could be better, great feel, good battery life.-If you can’t afford or just can’t bring yourself to justify a $150 mouse like a superlight or viper ultimate id highly recommend the Model O wireless.Pros:-Good color and quality-Battery life-USB-C charging-Comfortable feel-Great buttons-Good RGB-Good Program for customizationCons:-It’s a con and a Note IMPORTANT!!!! DO NOT USE THE “MODEL O” PROGRAM!!! For whatever reason it doesn’t work 90% of the time and it’s a well-known issue HOWEVER USE THE “Glorious Core” program off their website and this mouse works just fine!-I hate to say it but there’s really no cons to the mouse, if there is it’s a personal and opinion based one, objectively there’s nothing wrong with the mouse.The Long:For better understanding of my review id like to preface that I’m a full-time video editor and I do play games heavily too. I’m also not the richest person so when I buy something I’m looking for what makes sense for the money and value. I searched for months for reviews between the top three mice in the game and industry and those are the Logitech Superlight, the Razor ultimate and this the model O. Now when I saw the price tags at the time respectively $150~, $120-100, $80~ I just couldn’t financially bring myself to spend over $100 BEFORE tax and shipping on a mouse I just couldn’t justify it. I spent $98 total for this mouse and online all the reviews put it in the same class with the “best gamming mouse ever made” the superlight. And I mean from my analysis its literally the competitor like if you compared a GT mustang to a Challenger and Charger classed cars respectively it would come to user preference. Any complaints on this mouse were nit picky at best about, 3-5 grams of weight (something I highly doubt a regular person would ever notice) or the specific “things” it comes with. I mean the superlight gets hated on for not having USB-C. So, here’s my honest opinion from what I can deduce.-----If you have the money and simply just want the best thing to say you have it, then buy a super light, if you want that but in Razer for some reason for their awful program that takes over you computer? Then buy the ultimate. BUT! If you’re a “normal” person who can’t justify spending over $100 on a mouse, then this is the bets you’ll ever do. The fact that its sub 100 and is in the same class ass the other two means something! I daily this thing and I went from an old cool master to a razor viper to this and I fell in love. For refence I have big meaty hands and the only downside is that for right-handed people the right side where your pinky rests is thinner then a viper so it took some time for me to get used to a “hour glass shaped” mouse. For $80 at the time, you get beautiful RGB, I do like it I mostly keep my turned off because it saves a bit of battery life as I use mine all day every day, the color of the mouse is a nice “matt” white, so it has this premium look to it like the color and texture they choose is beautiful. The clicks and center wheel are fantastic. As far as I can tell its light weight. I don’t personally notice the honeycomb so that’s a personal preference miles may vary. It comes with the charging cable that’s long enough to act as the mouse cable if you need to charge while you play and it’s a braided line so its almost like its not there HOWEVER you wont even use it long! Because this is USB-C it charges in a matter of minutes. I’m not joking, if my mouse gets to 30% ish ill plug it in and no lie walk away to get water come back it’ll be at 50% ill maybe google something watch one video or que for a match and it’ll be at 100% like its insane and as to why Logitech doesn’t use USB-C I can’t for the life of me understand its so useful. The Dongle it comes with is good quality and I usually leave it plugged in on my desk so when I need to charge ill just unplug the dongle and plug the remote in and done. The program is what sold this for me. Now, throw back to my previous note the “model o” standalone program just dose not work. No one knows why and it’s been an issue for years, the “glorious core” program works perfectly fine and recognizes the mouse with no issues and has plenty of customization. Some specifics, you can move your DPI sliders you get 5 I believe, and they can be color coded to what ever colors you like I usually set my blue to 2000 DPI and just keep it there but you can set them where you like and depending on what your doing you can adjust the DPI on the mouse and the color under the mouse will indicate which DPI setting its on. You can adjust the color brightness in increments which is insane to me I’ve never seen RGB where the brightness is a slider!! And the best part you can separate the RGB from the mouse “plugged in” or not, let me explain. If the mouse is plugged in you can tell the program what percentage of RGB brightness you’d like it to be and if its unplugged what you’d like it to be for example when my mouse is un plugged I have it set to 0% (again I run mine all day so I like to keep the RGB off ) but, I have it set to 60% when plugged in so while its off when I’m using it the second  I plug the mouse in to charge the RGB kicks on. I just think its super cool, you can set it for battery life to if the battery gets to low you can have it adjust the RGB. As for battery life it works for days without charging. I haven’t killed it yet but I also frequently forget to  turn it off, the mouse does have a setting for sleep mode so if you don’t use it for a while it “sleeps” itself saving your battery life this is annoying if your in game and don’t move for a while you have to jiggle the mouse to get it to turn back on BUT this setting can be adjusted or turned off so no worries! Again, with me frequently forgetting to turn it off ill only have to charge it maybe every 3 days at the worst. The longest I’ve gone is 5 days no charge. Again, that’s someone using it all day every day and then when I need to charge it I usually find a coinvent spot like if I need to go to the bathroom or make food that’s when ill charge it and its always done when I come back it’s like charging isn’t even an issue that I’ve ever noticed, I’ve never been annoyed by it."}

Now to find out there is a V2, I would be looking to test it out in the future. But I am so happy with Model O and the customer services from Glorious.Initial review: I am writing this review to give an honest opinion. This is a great mouse but does not last long....I bought this mouse 3 months ago, My buttons are stuck and battery does not last for a day. I have to charge my mouse at least once or twice a day. Which is frustrating because it typically happens in the middle of a game now you being held down by the wire.For a minimal design layout, it should at least be user friendly to repair. This things tact on and there is a high possibility on breaking the plastic clips"}

Same thing. but now it doesn't click at all. The cursor moves on both PC's, but I can't click anything on either. So I test my other laptop with a different mouse. Working fine, plug in the Model D, and it breaks the laptop.You can try reinstalling drivers, or glorious core. Doesn't help. The only way to fix this problem is by completely reinstalling windows. Glorious isn't doing anything about this despite reaching out multiple times.Update: I contacted customer support and they offered 1 of 2 options, a free replacement, or store credit equal to it's worth.

The UI doesn't make sense and the instructions really fail. For example... to update firmware of wireless mouse you have to connect your mouse by cable and the receiver directly to the computer. After 5-6 failed attempts i tried this and worked flawlessly.-There is a button on main page of software saying Version 1.x.x.x and right under \"retry firmware update\". First of all that's really confusing because the version is the app version and not the firmware version. Secondly my firmware installed successfully so I should not see retry firmware update if there is no reason for it.So overall great mouse, buy with confidence. Battery holds really well if you deactivate RGB while wireless. You can check battery status by keeping dpi button pressed 3 seconds. Support is great on my first interaction."}

The shape is a great ambidex shape that is similar to the original Model O with some great updates.  The most noticeable is the move towards circular holes, but that is just aesthetics (I like it, but probably a matter of personal taste).  Another big change to the physical unit is the left and right buttons.  I think the look is more modern and smoother which is a nice touch.  I also like the new updated logo on the top (I think the new logo is a big improvement and also not as much in your face as the original Model O).  On the bottom of the mouse, you will see there are slight changes in the feet which I think should make it smoother (never had and issues so to me both are very smooth - though remember to take off the paper on the bottom!).  Last thing is the RGB seems a little more slick on the side of the mouse (comparing the 'ends' of the light strip you can see more variation/getting more to a point which aligns with the streamlined/modern look).There are a few other upgrades.  The first is adding BT connectivity.  I like the option, but I wouldn't use BT for gaming.  However it is there in case I want it (I use my mouse for gaming and for everyday and sometimes I have to travel, which is where the BT comes in so I don't have to travel with a dongle).  Another upgrade is the click feel.  When I put it against the original, I think there is more crispness to the click feel and also a little louder (not much but it is there when I click them side by side).  Last is the scroll wheel.  The design changed and I feel as though it is a little more responsive.One note is I had a slight issue out of the box and had to re-pair the dongle before updating the FW.  Not a big deal and I bet they update the FW better out of the box on future units.Overall I loved the mouse and would highly recommend!"}

Overall, I must admit that this mouse delivers on those fronts with exceptional performance and ergonomic design. However, I encountered some challenges with its Bluetooth functionality that dampened my initial excitement.Performance and Precision:The Glorious Model O V2 truly lives up to its reputation when it comes to performance and precision. The Pixart PMW3360 sensor provides smooth and accurate tracking, making it a reliable companion during intense gaming sessions. The customizable DPI settings allow me to adapt the mouse's sensitivity to my preferred gameplay style effortlessly. For gaming enthusiasts seeking top-tier performance, this mouse will undoubtedly impress.Ergonomic Design:As someone who spends prolonged hours gaming, the ergonomic design of the Model O V2 is a welcome feature. The low-profile shape fits comfortably in my hand, and the lightweight build reduces fatigue during extended use. The sleek honeycomb design adds a unique touch while maintaining a sturdy structure. This mouse has undoubtedly elevated my gaming experience, allowing me to play for hours without discomfort.Bluetooth Pairing Difficulties:While the Glorious Model O V2 is an outstanding wired gaming mouse, I encountered difficulties with its Bluetooth functionality. The USB dongle provided with the mouse did not work as expected, leaving me unable to pair it wirelessly. Attempting to pair it via Bluetooth directly from my PC's settings was also a bit cumbersome and time-consuming. The process could undoubtedly benefit from simplification and clearer instructions.Re-Pairing Issue:One significant drawback I experienced was that whenever I plugged the mouse back in while it was still connected via Bluetooth, it required re-pairing with my PC. This interruption in the connection was somewhat inconvenient, especially during intense gaming sessions when every second matters.Conclusion:The Glorious Model O V2 gaming mouse excels in terms of performance, comfort, and build quality, making it an excellent choice for gaming enthusiasts. The precision and ergonomic design have greatly enhanced my gaming experience, and I couldn't be happier with those aspects. However, I can't overlook the challenges I faced with the Bluetooth pairing process and the need to re-pair after plugging the mouse back in.For users who primarily intend to use this mouse wired, the Glorious Model O V2 is an exceptional choice. However, if Bluetooth connectivity is a crucial factor for you, it's worth considering the potential complications with the pairing process. I hope that future updates or firmware improvements will address these issues and make the Bluetooth functionality as seamless as the wired performance. Despite these setbacks, I still find the Glorious Model O V2 to be a top-performing gaming mouse, and I'm optimistic about its potential with some refinements."}

For $80 at the time, you get beautiful RGB, I do like it I mostly keep my turned off because it saves a bit of battery life as I use mine all day every day, the color of the mouse is a nice “matt” white, so it has this premium look to it like the color and texture they choose is beautiful. The clicks and center wheel are fantastic. As far as I can tell its light weight. I don’t personally notice the honeycomb so that’s a personal preference miles may vary. It comes with the charging cable that’s long enough to act as the mouse cable if you need to charge while you play and it’s a braided line so its almost like its not there HOWEVER you wont even use it long! Because this is USB-C it charges in a matter of minutes. I’m not joking, if my mouse gets to 30% ish ill plug it in and no lie walk away to get water come back it’ll be at 50% ill maybe google something watch one video or que for a match and it’ll be at 100% like its insane and as to why Logitech doesn’t use USB-C I can’t for the life of me understand its so useful. The Dongle it comes with is good quality and I usually leave it plugged in on my desk so when I need to charge ill just unplug the dongle and plug the remote in and done. The program is what sold this for me. Now, throw back to my previous note the “model o” standalone program just dose not work. No one knows why and it’s been an issue for years, the “glorious core” program works perfectly fine and recognizes the mouse with no issues and has plenty of customization. Some specifics, you can move your DPI sliders you get 5 I believe, and they can be color coded to what ever colors you like I usually set my blue to 2000 DPI and just keep it there but you can set them where you like and depending on what your doing you can adjust the DPI on the mouse and the color under the mouse will indicate which DPI setting its on. You can adjust the color brightness in increments which is insane to me I’ve never seen RGB where the brightness is a slider!! And the best part you can separate the RGB from the mouse “plugged in” or not, let me explain. If the mouse is plugged in you can tell the program what percentage of RGB brightness you’d like it to be and if its unplugged what you’d like it to be for example when my mouse is un plugged I have it set to 0% (again I run mine all day so I like to keep the RGB off ) but, I have it set to 60% when plugged in so while its off when I’m using it the second  I plug the mouse in to charge the RGB kicks on. I just think its super cool, you can set it for battery life to if the battery gets to low you can have it adjust the RGB. As for battery life it works for days without charging. I haven’t killed it yet but I also frequently forget to  turn it off, the mouse does have a setting for sleep mode so if you don’t use it for a while it “sleeps” itself saving your battery life this is annoying if your in game and don’t move for a while you have to jiggle the mouse to get it to turn back on BUT this setting can be adjusted or turned off so no worries! Again, with me frequently forgetting to turn it off ill only have to charge it maybe every 3 days at the worst. The longest I’ve gone is 5 days no charge. Again, that’s someone using it all day every day and then when I need to charge it I usually find a coinvent spot like if I need to go to the bathroom or make food that’s when ill charge it and its always done when I come back it’s like charging isn’t even an issue that I’ve ever noticed, I’ve never been annoyed by it."}

These guys are spot-on and very professional. I was seeking a resolution and got what I was looking for. I was so happy they worked with me. Like I said before, this mouse was great and is still great. I may received a bad mouse but was quickly replaced and I am extremely satisfied. Now to find out there is a V2, I would be looking to test it out in the future. But I am so happy with Model O and the customer services from Glorious.Initial review: I am writing this review to give an honest opinion. This is a great mouse but does not last long....I bought this mouse 3 months ago, My buttons are stuck and battery does not last for a day. I have to charge my mouse at least once or twice a day. Which is frustrating because it typically happens in the middle of a game now you being held down by the wire.For a minimal design layout, it should at least be user friendly to repair. This things tact on and there is a high possibility on breaking the plastic clips"}

I've been using it fine since I got it a couple months ago, but just 4 days ago the back button stopped working on my PC. So I plug it into my laptop to see if it's a software or harware problem. Same thing. but now it doesn't click at all. The cursor moves on both PC's, but I can't click anything on either. So I test my other laptop with a different mouse. Working fine, plug in the Model D, and it breaks the laptop.You can try reinstalling drivers, or glorious core. Doesn't help. The only way to fix this problem is by completely reinstalling windows. Glorious isn't doing anything about this despite reaching out multiple times.Update: I contacted customer support and they offered 1 of 2 options, a free replacement, or store credit equal to it's worth. I chose the second option as I only payed $55 on Amazon so I basically got $25 for free."}

The UI doesn't make sense and the instructions really fail. For example... to update firmware of wireless mouse you have to connect your mouse by cable and the receiver directly to the computer. After 5-6 failed attempts i tried this and worked flawlessly.-There is a button on main page of software saying Version 1.x.x.x and right under \"retry firmware update\". First of all that's really confusing because the version is the app version and not the firmware version. Secondly my firmware installed successfully so I should not see retry firmware update if there is no reason for it.So overall great mouse, buy with confidence. Battery holds really well if you deactivate RGB while wireless. You can check battery status by keeping dpi button pressed 3 seconds. Support is great on my first interaction."}

The shape is a great ambidex shape that is similar to the original Model O with some great updates.  The most noticeable is the move towards circular holes, but that is just aesthetics (I like it, but probably a matter of personal taste).  Another big change to the physical unit is the left and right buttons.  I think the look is more modern and smoother which is a nice touch.  I also like the new updated logo on the top (I think the new logo is a big improvement and also not as much in your face as the original Model O).  On the bottom of the mouse, you will see there are slight changes in the feet which I think should make it smoother (never had and issues so to me both are very smooth - though remember to take off the paper on the bottom!).  Last thing is the RGB seems a little more slick on the side of the mouse (comparing the 'ends' of the light strip you can see more variation/getting more to a point which aligns with the streamlined/modern look).There are a few other upgrades.  The first is adding BT connectivity.  I like the option, but I wouldn't use BT for gaming.  However it is there in case I want it (I use my mouse for gaming and for everyday and sometimes I have to travel, which is where the BT comes in so I don't have to travel with a dongle).  Another upgrade is the click feel.  When I put it against the original, I think there is more crispness to the click feel and also a little louder (not much but it is there when I click them side by side).  Last is the scroll wheel.  The design changed and I feel as though it is a little more responsive.One note is I had a slight issue out of the box and had to re-pair the dongle before updating the FW.  Not a big deal and I bet they update the FW better out of the box on future units.Overall I loved the mouse and would highly recommend!"}

I came from the first gen Model O, then I get the wireless version on which the battery life was horrible. Couldn’t get through a day of work/gaming without needing to charge it.

There is absolutely no way this battery last 210hrs, that’s why I gave it 3 stars.Besides that the mouse feels great and handles amazing, super lights, RGB isn’t too much, and the lightness of the mouse is awesome.UPDATE: upping this to 4 stars after Glorious reached out to discuss my concerns. Definitely appreciate the customer service and friendliness of the rep. There is an issue where after the machine shuts off, the mouse continues to stay on, this will be fixed on their next firmware update, they recommend shutting off the mouse when not in use until then."}
{"asin": "B098RDJZFM", "username": "Amazon Customer", "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\nGlorious Model O V2 - Excellent Performance, but Bluetooth Pairing Needs Improvement", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023", "purchased": "Size: StandardStyle: Model O 2Color: Black", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I recently purchased the Glorious Model O V2 gaming mouse with great anticipation, drawn in by its promises of precision and comfort. Overall, I must admit that this mouse delivers on those fronts with exceptional performance and ergonomic design. However, I encountered some challenges with its Bluetooth functionality that dampened my initial excitement.Performance and Precision:The Glorious Model O V2 truly lives up to its reputation when it comes to performance and precision. The Pixart PMW3360 sensor provides smooth and accurate tracking, making it a reliable companion during intense gaming sessions. The customizable DPI settings allow me to adapt the mouse's sensitivity to my preferred gameplay style effortlessly. For gaming enthusiasts seeking top-tier performance, this mouse will undoubtedly impress.Ergonomic Design:As someone who spends prolonged hours gaming, the ergonomic design of the Model O V2 is a welcome feature. The low-profile shape fits comfortably in my hand, and the lightweight build reduces fatigue during extended use. The sleek honeycomb design adds a unique touch while maintaining a sturdy structure. This mouse has undoubtedly elevated my gaming experience, allowing me to play for hours without discomfort.Bluetooth Pairing Difficulties:While the Glorious Model O V2 is an outstanding wired gaming mouse, I encountered difficulties with its Bluetooth functionality. The USB dongle provided with the mouse did not work as expected, leaving me unable to pair it wirelessly. Attempting to pair it via Bluetooth directly from my PC's settings was also a bit cumbersome and time-consuming. The process could undoubtedly benefit from simplification and clearer instructions.Re-Pairing Issue:One significant drawback I experienced was that whenever I plugged the mouse back in while it was still connected via Bluetooth, it required re-pairing with my PC. This interruption in the connection was somewhat inconvenient, especially during intense gaming sessions when every second matters.Conclusion:The Glorious Model O V2 gaming mouse excels in terms of performance, comfort, and build quality, making it an excellent choice for gaming enthusiasts. The precision and ergonomic design have greatly enhanced my gaming experience, and I couldn't be happier with those aspects. However, I can't overlook the challenges I faced with the Bluetooth pairing process and the need to re-pair after plugging the mouse back in.For users who primarily intend to use this mouse wired, the Glorious Model O V2 is an exceptional choice. However, if Bluetooth connectivity is a crucial factor for you, it's worth considering the potential complications with the pairing process. I hope that future updates or firmware improvements will address these issues and make the Bluetooth functionality as seamless as the wired performance. Despite these setbacks, I still find the Glorious Model O V2 to be a top-performing gaming mouse, and I'm optimistic about its potential with some refinements."}

Feeling that if I spent a third of the price of name brand mice, and still got 2-3 years of use, then I was winning the game so to speak.After my last mouse started not registering clicks at the most inopportune times, I finally realized that I needed to look at a quality mouse. That's where the Razer Deathadder Essential comes in. What a world of difference!The Good: Size. It is LARGE. For someone with larger hands, typical mice in the budget category were often just adequate to just a bit too small. The Deathadder fits and feels like a substantial extension of my hand.  Weight. The Deathadder is heavy. Not ridiculous heavy, but heavy enough you feel you are moving something. I happen to love this about the Deathadder. It gives me the weighted feedback that I am moving the mouse in a way that I want, not by accident because it was too light and it lifted and shifted it's position because of a minute twitch of my wrist.  Adjustable: Having multiple dpi and mhz settings allows me to fine tune the Deathadder to suit my use case needs. 5 settings will be all you need to choose what works best for you.The Bad: Lighting. The single color lighting would be nice if I could adjust that single color to fit the theme of my setup instead of just the Razer Green. If there is a way to change that color in the software, it's well hidden. This is a cosmetic thing and in no way adversely affects the performance of the Deathadder.Overall, if you are a person with larger hands, that wants a mouse of substance to help you perform better in game or on task, and comes in at an EXTREMELY budget friendly price, this is the mouse for you!"}

We all prefer to have products where support doesn't matter because it isn't needed but this is not such a product, and the product support is absolutely terrible. The mouse has scroll wheel issues (google it) that causes your screen to jump up and down as you scroll and it gets worse with time.I've contacted support and they take forever to reply many days. I got the first reply in 3ish days which I replied to instantly (they asked for proof of purchase which they could have done initially when they ask for other information but I suspect this is a tactic to make you give up) - another week goes on without replies and I call the support. They say my proof of purchase is good, the case is good, and escalates to the warranty department. They email me back in about 24h to tell me that I sent the proof of purchase in the wrong file format and to please send the correct format. I do this and I call the support back which tells me theres nothing they can do because the warranty department won't talk on the phone.I first started my support journey on Aug 22nd, and today is Sept 2nd and I've gotten absolutely nowhere - I don't know what will happen but I'll update to let y'all know if you at least get help if you can be bothered to be persistent. I've had another razer product in the past that also broke down but I bought it used to so no recourse - this doesn't happen to Logitech and Microsoft mice (well, I'm sure it does but so far I've never had a mouse die except the only two razer mice I've ever owned) so I don't know whats up with the quality and when it isn't backed up by good support it's very hard to recommend their products even if they do indeed perform well while they work!"}

I've had the Razer Mamba Elite mouse for a few months now and decided to upgrade to fit my white set up. I looked damn near everywhere for this mouse, only to realize it was a Chinese exclusive! I didn't realize the white mouse on Razer's website for their Mercury collection was a Viper, not a DeathAdder. Anyway, so I took to Amazon. I bought this on a whim and then I realized that I probably didn't buy an authentic Razer product so I was worried about some inconsistencies in the quality I'm used to. Sure enough, the white DeathAdder does exist to Razer, just in a different country!After receiving this mouse and getting it set up, I realized that there wasn't that big of a difference from that of my Mamba Elite. I was worried considering I had small hands and a lot of people say the DeathAdder was designed for larger hands. Safe to say, that is not true at all! If anything, my hands rested on the little clickers perfectly! The texture of the mouse felt nice as well. It's also a quiet click, if you're into quieter clicking switches. To note, if you're crazy about RGB (like I am) this probably is not the mouse for you. While the lighting on the mouse is nice, it is only white. But it sure is a BRIGHT white!So to recap, the mouse serves its purpose. The color and texture is nice, so is the lighting, the DPI is adjustable but only within Synapse, fits nicely in the hand, and doesn't have that \"cheap\" feel to it. Awesome mouse at an awesome price point!"}
{"asin": "B07Y693ND1", "username": "Paul", "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\nComfortable, good tracking, iffy wheel, and too \"light\" in the hand", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020", "purchased": "Color: Classic Black", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "At approximately $30, I thought that this mouse was well priced; previously, it was selling for $50-60, which I think it too much for it. I would like to point out three features that stand out to me. (1) This mouse is comfortable in the right hand. It is slightly larger than average, which is a good thing. My hands are average, and smaller mice make me feel like I have to pay attention to where they are all the time, or they will disappear. This mouse does not draw undue attention to itself. Importantly, it is sufficiently wide for the thumb and pinky to rest on it comfortably, and it is raised just the right amount under the base of the index finger. This make it easy to hold without having to squeeze, and the hand rests on it comfortably. This helps make the mouse ergonomic and to feel \"organic\" in the hand. These are this mouse's strongest features, in my opinion. (2) The mouse appears to perform quite well in terms of how the pointer motion \"feels\" on the screen. The coordination between the movement of the mouse and the movement of the pointer is flawless. Before this mouse, I had another highly sensitive mouse set up on my computer, and it was not pretty, although adjusting the software settings helped partially. The transition to this mouse felt like a major improvement, and I only had to weak the pointer speed slightly. The pointer movements feel smooth and precise. (3) I wish this mouse were a little heavier. I also wish that the wheel feet a little more substantial. Both the mouse and the wheel require a tiny bit of effort to move, and this is not enough for my comfort. This is especially problematic with the wheel. The finger slides on the wheel without triggering it, requiring mental effort to press on the wheel to turn it, but not too hard to click it. This is a major disadvantages of this mouse. I would say another 20-40 grams of weight to the body of the mouse would have made all the difference. And a slightly more resistant or rubbery wheel would have made a difference. The relatively lightness of the mouse and low resistance of the wheel draw attention to themselves and take away a sensation of substance that I enjoy in a mouse. That being said, the mouse feels more substantial than your average, cheap, smallish, light, plastic mouse. Some users may prefer their mouse on the lighter side, and some users may like a greasy wheel that is hard to rotate, but I do not."}

I usually buy cheaper off-brand peripherals for my PC, but I decided to give a more reputable brand a try.Something I should have been more aware of is the size and weight of the mouse. I tend to prefer small, lightweight mice, and have favored Finalmouse light replicas for a long time because of this. The razer mouse is a lot larger, heavier, and more ergonomic for the shape of the hand. It took awhile to get used to, but I've no complaints about it now, after the initial adjustment to the switch.The only major downside to this mouse is the Razer software. Razer Central usually works quickly and responsively, and also doesn't show any increased CPU usage on my potato PC. Synapse, however, is awful. Which is a shame because Synapse controls every single feature on any Razer peripherals you have. It's laggy, takes forever to open after turning the PC on, and upticks the CPU usage (not by much, but I tend to be extra aware of CPU because, yeah, potato PC).Overall, it's a good mouse and my only real negative is regarding the software, which, technically, you aren't forced to use, though you will not be able to customize DPI or LED brightness without it."}

Pointedly the mouse lights up by default.  It's a distraction.  You can turn it off, but requires installing the software.  (You can change that, then disable the software on startup so it's not eating resources ... a plus).  There also, in simplest terms, not enough buttons, including no DPI adjuster on the mouse, and no tilt function to the mouse wheel itself.  It has push down and scroll of course on the wheel.  (Though existing button location is good, and every button is crisp).  I have hands big enough to easily palm a basketball and I find it comfortable, but my 4 year old girl does too.

Feeling that if I spent a third of the price of name brand mice, and still got 2-3 years of use, then I was winning the game so to speak.After my last mouse started not registering clicks at the most inopportune times, I finally realized that I needed to look at a quality mouse. That's where the Razer Deathadder Essential comes in. What a world of difference!The Good: Size. It is LARGE. For someone with larger hands, typical mice in the budget category were often just adequate to just a bit too small. The Deathadder fits and feels like a substantial extension of my hand.  Weight. The Deathadder is heavy. Not ridiculous heavy, but heavy enough you feel you are moving something. I happen to love this about the Deathadder. It gives me the weighted feedback that I am moving the mouse in a way that I want, not by accident because it was too light and it lifted and shifted it's position because of a minute twitch of my wrist.  Adjustable: Having multiple dpi and mhz settings allows me to fine tune the Deathadder to suit my use case needs. 5 settings will be all you need to choose what works best for you.The Bad: Lighting. The single color lighting would be nice if I could adjust that single color to fit the theme of my setup instead of just the Razer Green. If there is a way to change that color in the software, it's well hidden. This is a cosmetic thing and in no way adversely affects the performance of the Deathadder.Overall, if you are a person with larger hands, that wants a mouse of substance to help you perform better in game or on task, and comes in at an EXTREMELY budget friendly price, this is the mouse for you!"}

The mouse has scroll wheel issues (google it) that causes your screen to jump up and down as you scroll and it gets worse with time.I've contacted support and they take forever to reply many days. I got the first reply in 3ish days which I replied to instantly (they asked for proof of purchase which they could have done initially when they ask for other information but I suspect this is a tactic to make you give up) - another week goes on without replies and I call the support. They say my proof of purchase is good, the case is good, and escalates to the warranty department. They email me back in about 24h to tell me that I sent the proof of purchase in the wrong file format and to please send the correct format. I do this and I call the support back which tells me theres nothing they can do because the warranty department won't talk on the phone.I first started my support journey on Aug 22nd, and today is Sept 2nd and I've gotten absolutely nowhere - I don't know what will happen but I'll update to let y'all know if you at least get help if you can be bothered to be persistent. I've had another razer product in the past that also broke down but I bought it used to so no recourse - this doesn't happen to Logitech and Microsoft mice (well, I'm sure it does but so far I've never had a mouse die except the only two razer mice I've ever owned) so I don't know whats up with the quality and when it isn't backed up by good support it's very hard to recommend their products even if they do indeed perform well while they work!"}

I've had the Razer Mamba Elite mouse for a few months now and decided to upgrade to fit my white set up. I looked damn near everywhere for this mouse, only to realize it was a Chinese exclusive! I didn't realize the white mouse on Razer's website for their Mercury collection was a Viper, not a DeathAdder. Anyway, so I took to Amazon. I bought this on a whim and then I realized that I probably didn't buy an authentic Razer product so I was worried about some inconsistencies in the quality I'm used to. Sure enough, the white DeathAdder does exist to Razer, just in a different country!After receiving this mouse and getting it set up, I realized that there wasn't that big of a difference from that of my Mamba Elite. I was worried considering I had small hands and a lot of people say the DeathAdder was designed for larger hands. Safe to say, that is not true at all! If anything, my hands rested on the little clickers perfectly! The texture of the mouse felt nice as well. It's also a quiet click, if you're into quieter clicking switches. To note, if you're crazy about RGB (like I am) this probably is not the mouse for you. While the lighting on the mouse is nice, it is only white. But it sure is a BRIGHT white!So to recap, the mouse serves its purpose. The color and texture is nice, so is the lighting, the DPI is adjustable but only within Synapse, fits nicely in the hand, and doesn't have that \"cheap\" feel to it. Awesome mouse at an awesome price point!"}
{"asin": "B07Y693ND1", "username": "Paul", "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\nComfortable, good tracking, iffy wheel, and too \"light\" in the hand", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020", "purchased": "Color: Classic Black", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "At approximately $30, I thought that this mouse was well priced; previously, it was selling for $50-60, which I think it too much for it. I would like to point out three features that stand out to me. (1) This mouse is comfortable in the right hand. It is slightly larger than average, which is a good thing. My hands are average, and smaller mice make me feel like I have to pay attention to where they are all the time, or they will disappear. This mouse does not draw undue attention to itself. Importantly, it is sufficiently wide for the thumb and pinky to rest on it comfortably, and it is raised just the right amount under the base of the index finger. This make it easy to hold without having to squeeze, and the hand rests on it comfortably. This helps make the mouse ergonomic and to feel \"organic\" in the hand. These are this mouse's strongest features, in my opinion. (2) The mouse appears to perform quite well in terms of how the pointer motion \"feels\" on the screen. The coordination between the movement of the mouse and the movement of the pointer is flawless. Before this mouse, I had another highly sensitive mouse set up on my computer, and it was not pretty, although adjusting the software settings helped partially. The transition to this mouse felt like a major improvement, and I only had to weak the pointer speed slightly. The pointer movements feel smooth and precise. (3) I wish this mouse were a little heavier. I also wish that the wheel feet a little more substantial. Both the mouse and the wheel require a tiny bit of effort to move, and this is not enough for my comfort. This is especially problematic with the wheel. The finger slides on the wheel without triggering it, requiring mental effort to press on the wheel to turn it, but not too hard to click it. This is a major disadvantages of this mouse. I would say another 20-40 grams of weight to the body of the mouse would have made all the difference. And a slightly more resistant or rubbery wheel would have made a difference. The relatively lightness of the mouse and low resistance of the wheel draw attention to themselves and take away a sensation of substance that I enjoy in a mouse. That being said, the mouse feels more substantial than your average, cheap, smallish, light, plastic mouse. Some users may prefer their mouse on the lighter side, and some users may like a greasy wheel that is hard to rotate, but I do not."}

I usually buy cheaper off-brand peripherals for my PC, but I decided to give a more reputable brand a try.Something I should have been more aware of is the size and weight of the mouse. I tend to prefer small, lightweight mice, and have favored Finalmouse light replicas for a long time because of this. The razer mouse is a lot larger, heavier, and more ergonomic for the shape of the hand. It took awhile to get used to, but I've no complaints about it now, after the initial adjustment to the switch.The only major downside to this mouse is the Razer software. Razer Central usually works quickly and responsively, and also doesn't show any increased CPU usage on my potato PC. Synapse, however, is awful. Which is a shame because Synapse controls every single feature on any Razer peripherals you have. It's laggy, takes forever to open after turning the PC on, and upticks the CPU usage (not by much, but I tend to be extra aware of CPU because, yeah, potato PC).Overall, it's a good mouse and my only real negative is regarding the software, which, technically, you aren't forced to use, though you will not be able to customize DPI or LED brightness without it."}

I normally use a wired mouse with my desktop/gaming pc, but recently starting using this one in it's place for regular duties and some FPS gaming.I chose this mouse because it uses the pixart PAW3370, which is one of the top optical sensors for mice right now when it comes to tracking accuracy.  I Also chose it because it has a few extra buttons on top (aside from the usual 2 side buttons).  I like to bind the extra buttons on top of the mouse for some in-game functions instead of using my keyboard.the mouse is a bit heavier than the current crop of super light weight mice, but it's still way lot lighter than my old G602 that had batteries in it.  it has a built-in battery, so that keeps the weight down.  battery life seems pretty decent so far.  I usually am online only for a few hours a day, and it's lasted a couple weeks and I have yet to charge it.  it will also work in wired mode, so you can use it while it charges.  it has 2 \"on\" modes: one with the full RGB lighting, and one that is like ECO mode, that let's you run with no lights, or with minimal lighting.  both modes allow you to run 1000hz polling rates.The left and right buttons are a little stiffer than my Asus mouse, but it doesn't affect my gameplay at all, and it's only noticeable when going from one mouse to the other.  the other buttons on the mouse feel good and are on par with any other well known name-brand mouse.The software is very easy to use, and is simple and lightweight.  I wish more companies would make their mouse software like this.  it allows you to set profiles, change lighting, bind the buttons, and program macros.  then lets you save it all to the on-board mouse memory, and then you can close the software and never run it again.  There are multiple DPI settings you can set, and/or turn on or off completely, a page for lighting controls, macro programming, button assignments, polling rate, speed settings, etc.  Basically all the typical mouse settings you'd ever need.After matching the dpi to my other mouse, I can say this mouse performs just as well as many more expensive mice.  The only difference I could feel was this mouse wasn't quite as \"fast\" as my other one.  the mouse skates weren't as slick.  I didn't mind though, and I was still able to aim accurately and quickly.After a few days I noticed that there was some plastic pealing up on one of the mouse skates.  They have a protective film on them!  this wasn't noticeable before, but after I peeled off all of the film, the mouse was sliding faster and easier, so make sure you check the mouse skates for the film."}

This mouse provides excellent value for money, and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.One of the standout features of the Reddragon M991 is its stunning RGB lighting. The illumination on this mouse is absolutely beautiful, adding a touch of style and customization to my gaming setup. The vibrant colors and various lighting effects create an immersive visual experience that enhances the overall gaming atmosphere.In terms of ergonomics, the Reddragon M991 excels. The grip is nothing short of perfect, offering a comfortable and secure hold during extended gaming sessions. As someone with larger hands, I particularly appreciate the weight of this mouse. It strikes a perfect balance, providing a satisfying heaviness that enhances precision and control. Lighter mice often feel flimsy and lack the stability I desire, but the Reddragon M991 caters perfectly to my preferences.While the mouse itself performs admirably, it's worth mentioning that the accompanying software leaves much to be desired. The functionality is limited and somewhat lacking, which is a shame considering its potential. However, this minor drawback doesn't significantly impact the overall experience for me. I find the mouse perfectly usable without relying heavily on the software, and it doesn't diminish my overall satisfaction with the product.All in all, the Reddragon M991 is an excellent purchase, especially for those seeking an affordable yet high-quality gaming mouse. Its value for money is exceptional, and the combination of beautiful RGB lighting and ergonomic design sets it apart from its competitors. Despite the software's limitations, the mouse itself performs admirably and caters to those who prefer a slightly heavier feel. I highly recommend the Reddragon M991 to anyone in search of a reliable and budget-friendly gaming mouse."}

{"asin": "B09NDJJJKQ", "username": "Mike Y.", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nA Solid Mouse with good sensor", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023", "purchased": "Color: BlackStyle: M991", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I picked this up a while back to use for my laptop when I work from home, and as a spare for my main desktop setup.  I normally use a wired mouse with my desktop/gaming pc, but recently starting using this one in it's place for regular duties and some FPS gaming.I chose this mouse because it uses the pixart PAW3370, which is one of the top optical sensors for mice right now when it comes to tracking accuracy.  I Also chose it because it has a few extra buttons on top (aside from the usual 2 side buttons).  I like to bind the extra buttons on top of the mouse for some in-game functions instead of using my keyboard.the mouse is a bit heavier than the current crop of super light weight mice, but it's still way lot lighter than my old G602 that had batteries in it.  it has a built-in battery, so that keeps the weight down.  battery life seems pretty decent so far.  I usually am online only for a few hours a day, and it's lasted a couple weeks and I have yet to charge it.  it will also work in wired mode, so you can use it while it charges.  it has 2 \"on\" modes: one with the full RGB lighting, and one that is like ECO mode, that let's you run with no lights, or with minimal lighting.  both modes allow you to run 1000hz polling rates.The left and right buttons are a little stiffer than my Asus mouse, but it doesn't affect my gameplay at all, and it's only noticeable when going from one mouse to the other.  the other buttons on the mouse feel good and are on par with any other well known name-brand mouse.The software is very easy to use, and is simple and lightweight.  I wish more companies would make their mouse software like this.  it allows you to set profiles, change lighting, bind the buttons, and program macros.  then lets you save it all to the on-board mouse memory, and then you can close the software and never run it again.  There are multiple DPI settings you can set, and/or turn on or off completely, a page for lighting controls, macro programming, button assignments, polling rate, speed settings, etc.  Basically all the typical mouse settings you'd ever need.After matching the dpi to my other mouse, I can say this mouse performs just as well as many more expensive mice.  The only difference I could feel was this mouse wasn't quite as \"fast\" as my other one.  the mouse skates weren't as slick.  I didn't mind though, and I was still able to aim accurately and quickly.After a few days I noticed that there was some plastic pealing up on one of the mouse skates.  They have a protective film on them!  this wasn't noticeable before, but after I peeled off all of the film, the mouse was sliding faster and easier, so make sure you check the mouse skates for the film."}

This mouse provides excellent value for money, and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.One of the standout features of the Reddragon M991 is its stunning RGB lighting. The illumination on this mouse is absolutely beautiful, adding a touch of style and customization to my gaming setup. The vibrant colors and various lighting effects create an immersive visual experience that enhances the overall gaming atmosphere.In terms of ergonomics, the Reddragon M991 excels. The grip is nothing short of perfect, offering a comfortable and secure hold during extended gaming sessions. As someone with larger hands, I particularly appreciate the weight of this mouse. It strikes a perfect balance, providing a satisfying heaviness that enhances precision and control. Lighter mice often feel flimsy and lack the stability I desire, but the Reddragon M991 caters perfectly to my preferences.While the mouse itself performs admirably, it's worth mentioning that the accompanying software leaves much to be desired. The functionality is limited and somewhat lacking, which is a shame considering its potential. However, this minor drawback doesn't significantly impact the overall experience for me. I find the mouse perfectly usable without relying heavily on the software, and it doesn't diminish my overall satisfaction with the product.All in all, the Reddragon M991 is an excellent purchase, especially for those seeking an affordable yet high-quality gaming mouse. Its value for money is exceptional, and the combination of beautiful RGB lighting and ergonomic design sets it apart from its competitors. Despite the software's limitations, the mouse itself performs admirably and caters to those who prefer a slightly heavier feel. I highly recommend the Reddragon M991 to anyone in search of a reliable and budget-friendly gaming mouse."}

Even though I'm not a gamer anymore, I still appreciate the flexibility of programmable buttons, and this mouse has really won me over.

It adds a touch of style to my setup, even if I'm not gaming as much as before.Plug and Play: Setting up this mouse was a breeze. It's a simple plug-and-play device, perfect for someone like me who wants things to work immediately without any hassle.Programmable Buttons: The programmable buttons are a lifesaver for me. Even though I'm not playing MMOs like I used to, having those extra buttons still comes in handy for work and recreational use. Customizing them to my liking adds a level of personalization that I really appreciate.Clean Crisp Movements: This mouse delivers smooth and precise movements. It's like gliding on air, and I can feel the difference compared to other mice I've used in the past.Cons:Miss My Naga's Num Pad Buttons: While the Razer DeathAdder V2 is fantastic, I do miss the convenience of the num pad buttons that my old Naga mouse had. They were super useful for tasks like Excel and gaming, and I sometimes find myself wishing I still had them.Overall, the Razer DeathAdder V2 Gaming Mouse has been a great addition to my setup. The cool lights, easy setup, and programmable buttons make it a versatile and enjoyable mouse to use. Going back to a wired mouse means no more worries about batteries running out."}

I use it so constantly and for so much heavy gaming you could consider this bit of a post-torture test review. I'm really happy with it so far outside of a few small issues and one that is slowly driving me insane.Pros:• Great responsiveness and sensitivity. In my shooters I'm able to do nearly aimbot reactions spinning right on target and it's quick. Has saved my butt many times.• That great sensitivity is adjustable and has up to 5 different sensitivity \"stages\" which are customizable from 100-20k dpi.• The extra buttons are great. One of the reasons I buy Razer products is the Synapse program which lets you assign buttons or keys as you prefer.• Fits comfortably in the hand for long periods of time. I am on the computer most of the day and haven't really had any major issues with the shape.• The mouse glides along the pad smoothly courtesy of the plastic feet. Unlike my previous mice they haven't budged after all this time.• The mouse looks slick and has just the right amount of lighting imo.• The braided cord doesn't get caught on things and makes it really easy to identify in my rat's nest of cables. There doesn't seem to be much if any in the way of wear even where it's constantly rubbing against the desk.• Being corded obviously means NO BATTERIES NEEDED!• It has an extra ring of the foot material around the optic that seems to keep the optic's hole pretty clean. Worst I've had to deal with is the occasional hair that slipped past.• It's durable. There's no such thing as a gamer that has never slammed their mouse and I'm no exception. It still works just fine after all the punishment I've put it through.• The price is great.

I find myself assigning mouse functions that need to have the turbo active to my Anansi's extra keys (best keyboard I've ever owned, almost a decade old now) which gives much more consistent \"Turbo\" style performance via it's macros. Not being able to create and assign macros for the mouse in Synapse hamstrings it's potential a bit.• The rearward side button can be stiff and feel like it's fighting you a bit with a sound to match when it finally gives.• The soft rubberized portion has a crater where my thumb sits below the two side buttons and is starting to disintegrate a bit on the other side and where my palm rests.

It's a great mouse and a good upgrade!Right away, I should note that you shouldn't get too fooled/confused by the \"8 programmable buttons\" tagline--it's counting every single button on the mouse, including the standard left and right click and buttons to adjust settings on the bottom of the mouse that you would never use during normal gameplay or computer use. The only two \"extra\" buttons on this mouse for gamebinding are the two on the left side you can click with your thumb. The other buttons are: left and right click, the mouse wheel, two buttons underneath the mouse wheel to adjust the DPI of the mouse, and a button on the bottom of the mouse to switch between profiles. So if you're wanting more buttons to use during gameplay--like, say, having an entire MMO hotbar on your mouse--this isn't the right one. It's useful if you just want to have a couple of buttons that are easily accessed though! I like using my mouse buttons for stuff like push-to-talk and melee attacks in FPS games.As for the changes compared to the previous version of the Deathadder mouse, they're small but for my use they're good QOL changes. The biggest improvement is the spot underneath the side buttons where you're meant to rest your thumb--in the previous version this was a glued-on rubber pad that game off after a year or so or use. In the V2 mouse, it's now a textured part of the rest of the material of the mouse--the only way it's coming off is if the entire mouse case comes off! I could see the texturing being warn a bit, but that's certainly better than my thumb being gummed up by glue after the pad fell off!The other main change that I've noticed is that I think this mouse is slightly smaller than the previous version. This is great for me, since I'm a woman with small palms and long, thin fingers--I often have problems using gaming mice and controllers comfortably. That being said, I'm not sure if this would be as comfortable for users with larger hands--if you're worried, I'd suggest seeing if you can get measurements for a mouse you find comfortable and then comparing it to the size of this mouse.I believe the profile and DPI buttons are also new features, although honestly I haven't messed with that much since I'm not experienced with those settings and I haven't needed it for my own gameplaying. It does seem like a good feature and the buttons seem like they're good quality and I've never accidentally pressed them during gameplay, which is great. Probably want to check other reviews if you need more information there.Looks-wise, this is simple, but pretty looking mouse. The light on the logo and mouse wheel is really colorful but not bright enough to be distracting when the lights are off in the room. It's pretty easy to use Razer's software to change the color to your tastes, or you can leave it on a default setting where it cycles through various colors in a rainbow order. I know there's also a feature that game devs can use to have the mouse colors be manipulated by the game itself, but I've only ever played one game where I know for sure this was implemented--Overwatch changes the color of the mouse based on the character you're playing as. I don't think it's been used by many other games, and honestly I don't find myself looking at my mouse that much while playing anyway--it's probably a feature that's more fun on keyboards.Overall, I think this is a really great mouse! I recommend it for people that game on their PC or otherwise use their computer enough to want something that has a few more features and/or is a bit more sturdy than a cheaper mouse. If you're a huge tech nerd or want more button options, it might be a better idea to save up for a more expensive mouse. But I think at this price point this mouse has a lot of comfort and control."}

I used to get Logitech but after going through three G300s in 4 years I decided to try this unit and am glad I did. My only complaint it Razer Synapse software is kind of clunky and none intuitive.

Even though I'm not a gamer anymore, I still appreciate the flexibility of programmable buttons, and this mouse has really won me over.

It adds a touch of style to my setup, even if I'm not gaming as much as before.Plug and Play: Setting up this mouse was a breeze. It's a simple plug-and-play device, perfect for someone like me who wants things to work immediately without any hassle.Programmable Buttons: The programmable buttons are a lifesaver for me. Even though I'm not playing MMOs like I used to, having those extra buttons still comes in handy for work and recreational use. Customizing them to my liking adds a level of personalization that I really appreciate.Clean Crisp Movements: This mouse delivers smooth and precise movements. It's like gliding on air, and I can feel the difference compared to other mice I've used in the past.Cons:Miss My Naga's Num Pad Buttons: While the Razer DeathAdder V2 is fantastic, I do miss the convenience of the num pad buttons that my old Naga mouse had. They were super useful for tasks like Excel and gaming, and I sometimes find myself wishing I still had them.Overall, the Razer DeathAdder V2 Gaming Mouse has been a great addition to my setup. The cool lights, easy setup, and programmable buttons make it a versatile and enjoyable mouse to use. Going back to a wired mouse means no more worries about batteries running out."}

In my shooters I'm able to do nearly aimbot reactions spinning right on target and it's quick.

Unlike my previous mice they haven't budged after all this time.• The mouse looks slick and has just the right amount of lighting imo.• The braided cord doesn't get caught on things and makes it really easy to identify in my rat's nest of cables. There doesn't seem to be much if any in the way of wear even where it's constantly rubbing against the desk.• Being corded obviously means NO BATTERIES NEEDED!• It has an extra ring of the foot material around the optic that seems to keep the optic's hole pretty clean. Worst I've had to deal with is the occasional hair that slipped past.• It's durable. There's no such thing as a gamer that has never slammed their mouse and I'm no exception.

Mouse is mainly used for both Internet and gaming on Total War - no issues at the moment.Mouse cord is USB-A and is very long - needed some cord ties to hold the excess so it wouldn't get in the way of other computer wires.

It was the 5-button, 3500 dpi version and it lasted me a bit over a decade.  I had such great success with it that I saw no reason to get anything other than the same one.  However, while searching for for the Death Adder, I noticed a \"V2\".  I thought, \"I liked the first version so much that I'll love the second one\".  Well... it is a nice mouse.  It has a nice feel to it,  the colors are vibrant, and the wheel is crisp.  The buttons are thoughtfully placed and it's as if they don't exist when you're not wanting to press them.  So It's a good mouse.  I download the software to control the colors, and I don't get too excited about the EUA; I've been using some version of the program for 10 years.However, the only reason I want to give it 4.5 stars is really just a preference thing.  It's just a fraction bigger than the Death Adder I was just using.  So it's not as seamless of a transition as I had hoped.  I may return it for a version 1, but will keep it for now to see if I can adjust.  The extra few buttons may come in handy someday and like I said, you don't notice they're there.Update: Returned and ordered the V3.  The V3 is near identical to my original mouse except way smoother/faster/lighter.  It also doesn't have color/RBG, but I'm ok with that as the LEDs make my palm sweat a little. It's perfect for me."}

My computer is from 2014 with mid-high specs by today's standards. My BIOS was last updated in 2019. This mouse will prevent my computer from passing POST. It will just hang until I completely unplug the mouse. As soon as I plug in the mouse while in BIOS, BIOS becomes unresponsive. Unplugging the mouse allows me to continue. Same thing with UEFI. I noticed a Synapse software prompt as soon as I plugged this mouse into my wife's laptop. So I tried plugging in a USB hub and running the mouse off of said hub. Now my computer boots successfully without having to unplug and re-plug the mouse. If you have boot issues you might try using a hub if you've got one available. For reference, my USB hub is an AmazonBasics USB 2.0 hub (B003M0NURK).  I like the ergonomics of this mouse for the most part. My only gripe is the flare on the right click feels a little too big to me. I think they could have shaved down the side a bit more. I don't have big hands so that could be part of the issue. From the tip of my middle finger to the bottom of my palm measures about 7 inches. Other than that, I really like this mouse. It's comfortable and the cable is awesome. It's lightweight and very flexible. I bought a mouse bungee to go with it and I probably don't need it now. I'm coming from a Redragon M711-FPS and this Razer makes Redragon's cable feel like a rigid rope. The click on the Razer is also much softer. It's not so soft that I'll accidentally click but it does make it easier/faster to click when needed.  I'm also running Linux Mint. I haven't been on Windows in a while. I can say this works really well on Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon. Two things you will need to successfully control this mouse and other Razer products on Linux are OpenRazer and Polychromatic. With those two additions you can control the settings, rgb, and even sync rgb across devices. I like the mouse and bungee I bought that I'm already looking at their keyboard.  And as far as support goes, they were helpful when I contacted them about my issue. My product showed up as being out of warranty even though it's brand-new but support assured me I have a 2 year warranty on the mouse. They sent me a link to update my firmware and gave me suggestions on troubleshooting the mouse to see if it needed to be replaced. The firmware had to be updated on Windows.

The original had webbing grips on the side that ended up peeling away (stuck back on with some double-sided tape). This V2 version has the grips already molded into the body of the mouse. Much better and does not look like it'll break apart.Buttons are lighter for pressing instead of slightly heavier. Scroll is also very precise and easy to use whether I'm gaming or internet browsing. Mouse is mainly used for both Internet and gaming on Total War - no issues at the moment.Mouse cord is USB-A and is very long - needed some cord ties to hold the excess so it wouldn't get in the way of other computer wires. The only minor issue is that the cord does pick up dust rather easily and is hard to clean - I'd rather not a cloth-like cord and the regular silicone-style ones. Mouse is very light and no issues with optical sensors."}

It was the 5-button, 3500 dpi version and it lasted me a bit over a decade.  I had such great success with it that I saw no reason to get anything other than the same one.  However, while searching for for the Death Adder, I noticed a \"V2\".  I thought, \"I liked the first version so much that I'll love the second one\".  Well... it is a nice mouse.  It has a nice feel to it,  the colors are vibrant, and the wheel is crisp.  The buttons are thoughtfully placed and it's as if they don't exist when you're not wanting to press them.  So It's a good mouse.  I download the software to control the colors, and I don't get too excited about the EUA; I've been using some version of the program for 10 years.However, the only reason I want to give it 4.5 stars is really just a preference thing.  It's just a fraction bigger than the Death Adder I was just using.  So it's not as seamless of a transition as I had hoped.  I may return it for a version 1, but will keep it for now to see if I can adjust.  The extra few buttons may come in handy someday and like I said, you don't notice they're there.Update: Returned and ordered the V3.  The V3 is near identical to my original mouse except way smoother/faster/lighter.  It also doesn't have color/RBG, but I'm ok with that as the LEDs make my palm sweat a little. It's perfect for me."}

My computer is from 2014 with mid-high specs by today's standards. My BIOS was last updated in 2019. This mouse will prevent my computer from passing POST. It will just hang until I completely unplug the mouse. As soon as I plug in the mouse while in BIOS, BIOS becomes unresponsive. Unplugging the mouse allows me to continue. Same thing with UEFI. I noticed a Synapse software prompt as soon as I plugged this mouse into my wife's laptop. So I tried plugging in a USB hub and running the mouse off of said hub. Now my computer boots successfully without having to unplug and re-plug the mouse. If you have boot issues you might try using a hub if you've got one available. For reference, my USB hub is an AmazonBasics USB 2.0 hub (B003M0NURK).  I like the ergonomics of this mouse for the most part. My only gripe is the flare on the right click feels a little too big to me. I think they could have shaved down the side a bit more. I don't have big hands so that could be part of the issue. From the tip of my middle finger to the bottom of my palm measures about 7 inches. Other than that, I really like this mouse. It's comfortable and the cable is awesome. It's lightweight and very flexible. I bought a mouse bungee to go with it and I probably don't need it now. I'm coming from a Redragon M711-FPS and this Razer makes Redragon's cable feel like a rigid rope. The click on the Razer is also much softer. It's not so soft that I'll accidentally click but it does make it easier/faster to click when needed.  I'm also running Linux Mint. I haven't been on Windows in a while. I can say this works really well on Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon. Two things you will need to successfully control this mouse and other Razer products on Linux are OpenRazer and Polychromatic. With those two additions you can control the settings, rgb, and even sync rgb across devices. I like the mouse and bungee I bought that I'm already looking at their keyboard.  And as far as support goes, they were helpful when I contacted them about my issue. My product showed up as being out of warranty even though it's brand-new but support assured me I have a 2 year warranty on the mouse. They sent me a link to update my firmware and gave me suggestions on troubleshooting the mouse to see if it needed to be replaced. The firmware had to be updated on Windows. I'm not sure if it can be done on Linux. I was also given a reference number in case I needed to contact support again. I'm sure everyone's experience is different, especially depending on the agent you get, but I thought it was worth noting."}

I finally got tired of having to replace the batteries in my archaic mouse. Always having to have AAA batteries on hand and never knowing when they were going to quit. Plus, my wrist was starting to hurt after decades of desk work. My shoulder also pinched by the end of the workday. I do have short fingers, so keep thst in mind when ordering. This mouse has been such a relief. It took just a few hours to get used to using it. The finger indentations are perfect and the button placement is in a convenient location. I didn't want just any old plain mouse, so I fell in love when I saw this one. It helps to put just a little fun into my workday. It comes with a magnetic attachment for your palm. I've tried working with it, but it makes it too bulky, the the mouse is pretty bulky already. If you have a lot of desk space, that might not be a problem for you. I'm working on an old vinyl coveted card table in my bedroom. The mouse doesn't slide easily on it so you might want to consider getting a mouse pad, as I need to do. I purposely waited a week to do this review because I wanted to see how the first charge lasted. **EDIT I was able to work two 40 hour work weeks on one charge. When the charge gets low, the lights stop working and just show red near the bottom. **I've worked a full 40 hour week and it's still going strong. I do keep the charging cord on my desk for when it does stop. I don't know if it let's you know when it's low, or not. I'm so pleased with this and am thankful I no longer have wrist and shoulder pain. Great product with good value."}

I've been told I have slightly small hands (approx. 7 inches or 18 cm from bottom of my palm to the tip of my middle finger), and the mouse is a touch too big for me for it to be fully comfortable. I can still use it, but it takes some stretching to use the scroll wheel.The palm rest is attached with 3 small magnets at the bottom of the mouse. It drags smoothly, but it's not a cushion. I think it's just something to help prevent the side of your hand from dragging along a desk/surface. I haven't used the mouse for long, but I'm mildly worried that palm rest will just come off as I'm using it because of how easy it is to come off.I do enjoy the overall feel of the mouse compared to the standard regular mouses. I also like the RBG lights as a simply cosmetic thing to make it appear fancy. I do not have an RBG gaming keyboard, but I assume it would match well with one.So far, and easy 4/5 stars. I only deduct one star simply because it's larger than expected and the slight disappointment in the lack of cushion in the palm rest. If there are any changes in my rating or thoughts, I'll give an update.Update:It's been a little under 4 weeks, and I have been using this mouse for about 8-12 hours every workday. I turn the mouse off during the night and weekends to conserve battery. There is definitely a learning curve, and since my hands are on the smaller size, I needed to find the right grip so that my arm didn't hurt after a lot of usage.I charged it fully when I first got it, and it just now ran out of battery. The palm rest is kinda heavy to drag around, so I'll sometimes take it off. Although, it is nice to have since the side of my hand doesn't drag across the desk. Essentially, my rating stays the same just because the palm rest is a bit heavy."}

The blue light--IMO--what's the point. I turned it off.  I think the rest of the review is worthwhile, but if you're not in mood to read, stop now.I've had this just over 3 wks. Still not totally adapted to it. I'm keeping it cause at this point, anything that works is a relief.=======================================================================================13Sep2018, has this 2 weeks. Long review, I know. Software useless. R&L click, forward & backwards, scrollwheel clicks.Switch on bottom for lite on/off. Button on bottom for DPI. Software's useless, so if u can't accept these defaults, look elsewhere. These defaults are what I would have chosen. If that's not for u, stop reading, go elsewhere.Wish that buttons were scooped. Hopefully, this thing will last. If you can accept the default button assignments, great, cause their software is bad. The only reason I don't hate it is that I've recently return 3 pointing devices, this one more or less works. The bar has been set VERY low.-----------------------------------------Had this <1 hr. Will adjust rating if needed. Put wrist rest on the thing immediately, even if u won't use it long term.I was confused which way it went for a bit, wrist rest makes it obvious. Also, cord should be at BACK end of mouse, away from u.-------------------Stupid picture in the tiny bit of instruction gives(which is enough, I guess) a picture that's exactly backwards of how it would look when u're  using it. Dumb. Confused me for a bit.Scooped side, when using, should be on left. Right hand operates right & left clicks, plus scroll-wheel.  It helped me to think this way: if u were using regular mouse, ur hand would have index finger on left click, mid or ring finger on right click. That's the same here. Pretend u lay the mouse over on its side, to the left. (of, course, it won't work that way, just picture it).----------------------Maybe this is stuff is obvious to others, it wasn't to me. Will take some accommodation  on my part, something slipped, this review was submitted part way thru. Had to return here to finish review. Probably my fault.-----------------------------Only 5 buttons, if u include scroll-wheel click. It'll have to do, I've had several recent failures w/trackballs & mice, I can only hope this gets me by, long term. I imagine it's impossible for them to put more buttons on this thing. This thing needs a mouse pad, which I don't have. Buttons are configured by default, in my opinion, in the most logical way, thus, for me, no software required. I'm not a gamer, so I don't know how this would work for games.--------------------------------------------I see a previous reviewer couldn't find the software to set the buttons to your liking. This was not an issue for me, as the default settings were exactly right for me. Before this mouse, I'd had 2 trackballs & another mouse, all quite recently, which needed to be returned. In 2 of those 3 cases, it was an inability to get the software or software that worked.Buttons are: r-click, l-click, back, forward, scroll wheel(middle click). Five buttons plus a scroll wheel. These for me, a non-gamer, are the minimum, fortunately, I didn't need software. The fancier stuff I had to return to Amazon, some of it had many extra buttons. With no software that worked, they had even less functionality than this mouse. This mouse was not my first choice, but my fourth choice!------------------------------------------As for needing a mousepad: I took a sheet of plain white paper to use for mousepad. It works. Maybe I'll get a mousepad, maybe not. Without a mousepad, the cursor started to creep all over screen. I can get a new mousepad as often as I wish, using white paper.Somewhere I read a guy used poster board or construction paper for making mousepads.------------------------------------------I read about what colors & such work best for mousepads. For everyone who said not to use a certain color or pattern, someone on the forum stated they'd had success w/the \"wrong\" color, or even a patterned mousepad.------------------------------Still have only owned this trackball less than 24 hrs, used it many hours already. So far, it's ok.  If there's a problem, I'll reduce my rating. This mouse seems to take a bit of getting used to, it's not too bad in that regard, I believe it's getting easier to use.---------------------------------------------Warning: my cursor began doing a little dance. Why? Called company, they were gonna send link to software, hopefully fixing problem. First email had me going nuts thru their site, inappropriate. Second email--worked, showed a mouse that looked standard, no relation to this mouse. So I'm guessing the software is useless.-----------------I got the mouse working---blew on the little red lite underneath. Not sure--may have been a cat hair there. The thing no longer has a dancing cursor. Thank goodness I want the default configuration, their software looks to be useless. I hope there'll be no more problems.wlb"}

I wanted something that would keep my hand in a natural position.  Unfortunately, this product, though it appears to be well made is not a good fit for everyone.Initially putting my hand in place on the mouse felt natural, until I started to use it.  Then my hand slipped down the side.  If I put my finger up on top of the mouse to keep from slipping, then that put my hand in a bent shape which is what I am trying to avoid doing.  It comes with a heel rest which needs to be used otherwise the hand rests on the table which gets uncomfortable from the constant movement.  Also, one needs to use a wrist rest to keep the hand up so it will be aligned with the buttons.As for the button placement, I liked the way that was designed.  Kudos for that and for the wheel placement.  But again, with the hand slipping on the mouse there is way too much movement to use the buttons and/or the wheel.The shape of the mouse reminds me of a snail.  When the hand is placed on the mouse \"properly\", then there is a gap between the back of the mouse and the palm of the hand.  Thus, one is actually putting that hand in a position of having to \"hold\" the hand up rather than letting it rest on the mouse.  I read somewhere a comment that said the mouse was like a joystick.  It loosely is.  At least with a joystick one can hold onto it and maneuver the buttons without all the hand movements to hold onto the joystick.I am 5'5\" with a medium sized hand.  I would say if it weren't for the slippage, this would be the ideal mouse configuration for a slightly smaller hand.  I will go back to the old-style ergonomic mouse where the hand can rest on top of it.  That is actually the best in my opinion.One last thing is the blue light that is on the mouse.  Luckily that can be turned off.  When it is on it is very annoying.  I don't know why that was put on to begin with.  It was a waste of time and more than likely money.Overall if one has a smaller hand this would possibly be a good fit.  Otherwise, shop around and be aware that this style will not fit everyone properly."}

I finally got tired of having to replace the batteries in my archaic mouse. Always having to have AAA batteries on hand and never knowing when they were going to quit. Plus, my wrist was starting to hurt after decades of desk work. My shoulder also pinched by the end of the workday. I do have short fingers, so keep thst in mind when ordering. This mouse has been such a relief. It took just a few hours to get used to using it. The finger indentations are perfect and the button placement is in a convenient location. I didn't want just any old plain mouse, so I fell in love when I saw this one. It helps to put just a little fun into my workday. It comes with a magnetic attachment for your palm. I've tried working with it, but it makes it too bulky, the the mouse is pretty bulky already. If you have a lot of desk space, that might not be a problem for you. I'm working on an old vinyl coveted card table in my bedroom. The mouse doesn't slide easily on it so you might want to consider getting a mouse pad, as I need to do. I purposely waited a week to do this review because I wanted to see how the first charge lasted. **EDIT I was able to work two 40 hour work weeks on one charge. When the charge gets low, the lights stop working and just show red near the bottom. **I've worked a full 40 hour week and it's still going strong. I do keep the charging cord on my desk for when it does stop. I don't know if it let's you know when it's low, or not. I'm so pleased with this and am thankful I no longer have wrist and shoulder pain. Great product with good value."}
{"asin": "B0759V6FZC", "username": "Grace", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat price, just a little big", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023", "purchased": "Size: V638 Wireless", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I got this mouse when it was on sale for ~$22 and the first thing I noticed was that it's a bit large. I've been told I have slightly small hands (approx. 7 inches or 18 cm from bottom of my palm to the tip of my middle finger), and the mouse is a touch too big for me for it to be fully comfortable. I can still use it, but it takes some stretching to use the scroll wheel.The palm rest is attached with 3 small magnets at the bottom of the mouse. It drags smoothly, but it's not a cushion. I think it's just something to help prevent the side of your hand from dragging along a desk/surface. I haven't used the mouse for long, but I'm mildly worried that palm rest will just come off as I'm using it because of how easy it is to come off.I do enjoy the overall feel of the mouse compared to the standard regular mouses. I also like the RBG lights as a simply cosmetic thing to make it appear fancy. I do not have an RBG gaming keyboard, but I assume it would match well with one.So far, and easy 4/5 stars. I only deduct one star simply because it's larger than expected and the slight disappointment in the lack of cushion in the palm rest. If there are any changes in my rating or thoughts, I'll give an update.Update:It's been a little under 4 weeks, and I have been using this mouse for about 8-12 hours every workday. I turn the mouse off during the night and weekends to conserve battery. There is definitely a learning curve, and since my hands are on the smaller size, I needed to find the right grip so that my arm didn't hurt after a lot of usage.I charged it fully when I first got it, and it just now ran out of battery. The palm rest is kinda heavy to drag around, so I'll sometimes take it off. Although, it is nice to have since the side of my hand doesn't drag across the desk. Essentially, my rating stays the same just because the palm rest is a bit heavy."}

It's of much higher quality than this garbage.It took me several weeks before I adapted to this thing, shortly thereafter, it failed. What a waste.

The comfort of the mouse was good and didnt take long to adapt to whatsoever. The issue I ran into was smoothness or \"mouse glide\" and mouse movement over my brand new mouse pad. I knew from previous reviews to make sure to remove the plastic on the feet. At first I thought it was the weight of the mouse apparently it wasn't. I still don't know what the issue was, I tried for a solid 2 hours to tinker setting via windows to replicate my higher old high DPI mouse. I got the sensitivity where it was close but something just didn't feel right in my brief MMO gaming session. In the end it wasn't a fit for me so I replaced it with a higher DPI ergonoical vertical gaming mouse specifically ZLOTs mouse. This one glides MUCH smoother and higher DPI is very nice as you will have with a wired lazer mouse.

I went from an Anker Ergonomic mouse, which wasn't bad. Although, I do have to say that this mouse is definitely an improvement and an upgrade. It is better designed and ergonomically more comfortable. I believe my home/study desktop is complete with this mouse. I am very pleased with my initial impression and will keep my eye out on what J-Tech develops next for their vertical mouse. Excellent experience so far!I'll write and updated review as time goes on, but for now I'm satisfied.Update after a day of use (3/21/2018): I will say that this mouse will take some getting use to. At times it feels closer to a joystick than a mouse. It is very much comfortable for my hands, which are between medium and large hands. I can see this mouse potentially being a problem for someone with very small hands or extremely large hands.This has been mentioned in another review here on Amazon, but the precision of the mouse is difficult to get use to. I'm getting the hang of it, but it is not something that will happen overnight. Some other reviewers mentioned how the mouse does not have precision, which led me to believe that the optics on the mouse itself may be of lower quality. This is not true. I find that it is the fact that you have to move your arm in a different way to get the precise movement that you intend. So there's a learning curve to say the least.But overall, my impression is that this is a high quality product that has high value for its price point. The next vertical mouse that I would consider is more than two times the cost of this.Also, the LED lights are a very nice touch. I do have to say that this Gen 2 version is much more attractive than the previous generation. This mouse honestly looks like a piece of art on my desk. Very unique looking and has very smooth contours that are appealing in a modern contemporary way.One other point of consideration is the Forward/Back buttons by the thumb rest. These are placed in a way that makes it extremely easy to trigger when using the mouse, but I have noticed that it is easy to press these buttons by mistake when grabbing the mouse to use. This is another part of the learning curve. When browsing websites it is very easy to use these Forward/Back buttons in the sense that it is lightning fast to trigger, but will require getting use to their placement.Still satisfied and hoping that there won't be any negative aspects to this mouse with future use.Update 4/15/2018After using this vertical mouse just under a month, I have nothing, but a positive experience to report.I have become accustomed to the design and my hand naturally grabs the mouse now. It was not as easy when first using for the first week or so. Now I am even able to use the mouse without a full on grab. I can just use my index finger, middle finger, and thumb to do a quick movement of the cursor. This greatly adds usability for causal use. When I'm fully engaged in what I'm doing on the computer I will use a full on hand grab, which is very comfortable to use indeed.The backward/forward buttons by the thumb position looked very cool in the photos of the J-Tech mouse, but it really is effective in use. When first getting use to the mouse, I would grab the mouse and inadvertently press one of the backward or forward buttons. This since has stopped after almost a month of use.I use this mouse on the right side of my Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard and a Logitech T650 touchpad on the left. I have become accustomed to this setup and I am glad I purchased this V-Tech mouse. I feel that my setup is complete now.Ultimately, I would say that this vertical mouse has a learning curve. If you are motivated to gain the benefits of its ergonomic design then I believe anyone can learn to use it within a month. But I do understand the few reviews that mention how it is nothing special or that it has an awkward design. It definitely is not for the average user. But for those that have a desire to move beyond an ordinary engagement with their work on a PC, this will definitely move you to the next level."}

The left and right mouse buttons were extremely sensitive the first two or three weeks, so I was accidentally clicking frequently when I didn't mean to. It seemed to just be a break-in period because almost 2 months in and it's much better now.My only issue is that the battery life doesn't seem to match the 180+ hour that was marketed, though even the marketing is inconsistent. The listing title states 180+ hours, but the product details states up to 180 hours. If I unplug the mouse to use it wirelessly, it maybe lasts 48-60 hours before it flashes red to indicate it needs to be plugged in. I initially thought it might have just been flashing red as a normal part of it switching colors, until it disconnected several minutes later until I charged it for a while. There's software that lets you turn off the RGB to extend the battery life, but I'd rather play with the RGB, it's just the product details could be a bit more transparent on what we can expect battery life-wise."}

This review will provide an in-depth analysis of the product, highlighting its pros and cons.Pros:  Lightweight Design: The mouse is skeletonized, making it incredibly light. This feature contributes to enhanced maneuverability and reduces fatigue during extended gaming or work sessions. The lightweight nature of the mouse allows for swift and precise movements.  Eye-catching RGB Lights: The RGB lighting on the mouse is visually appealing and adds a touch of flair to your gaming setup. The vibrant colors and effects create an immersive experience, especially in a gaming environment. However, it's worth noting that the aesthetics might not be suitable for a professional work setting.  Thumb Buttons: The mouse boasts five conveniently placed buttons for the thumb. These extra buttons can be customized to suit your needs, providing quick access to macros or other functions. The intuitive placement of these buttons enhances gaming and productivity, allowing for seamless control and efficiency.  Excellent Supporting Software: SteelSeries provides downloadable software that complements the mouse perfectly. This software allows you to customize various aspects of the mouse, including DPI settings, button mapping, and RGB lighting effects. The extensive customization options ensure that the mouse can be tailored to your specific preferences and gaming style.Cons:  Awkwardly Placed Buttons: One notable drawback is that two of the mouse buttons are situated in unconventional locations, making them awkward to use. These buttons require pressing them either upwards or downwards, which can be uncomfortable and disruptive to your grip. As a result, some users, including myself, tend to avoid using these particular buttons altogether.  Gamer Aesthetic: The mouse design clearly leans towards a gamer-centric style. While this may be a positive aspect for gaming enthusiasts, it may not appeal to individuals seeking a more subtle or professional-looking mouse. The aggressive styling and RGB lighting might not blend well with a professional work environment.  Battery Life: The battery life isn't terrible but it's also not great. It does come with a fabric usb cable to charge it and it charges very fast, but the shorter battery life can be annoying if it dies while in use.In conclusion, the SteelSeries mouse offers several impressive features that make it a desirable choice for gamers and enthusiasts. Its lightweight design, customizable thumb buttons, and captivating RGB lighting add value to the overall user experience. Additionally, the supporting software provides extensive customization options.However, it's important to note that the placement of two buttons can be awkward, leading to discomfort and the potential for limited usage. Furthermore, the gamer aesthetic may not be suitable for everyone, especially those seeking a more professional-looking mouse.If you prioritize a lightweight and customizable gaming mouse and appreciate the visual appeal of RGB lighting, this mouse is worth considering. Just be aware of the potential button placement issues and ensure that the gamer-centric design aligns with your preferences and environment."}

{"asin": "B09VNTCZZN", "username": "Troy H.", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nTakes some getting used to, but a good mouse", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2023", "purchased": "Style: WiredPattern Name: Aerox 5", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I come from using a much heavier mouse so switching to this ultra light-weight mouse is taking some getting used to. Tinkering with the engine settings in the GG app is a must to get your CPI settings right.I really like the button placement, though the 7-8 can be a bit awkward since they are up and down rather than push in. The 9 button is placed a little further out so it prevents accidental presses which was a major problem with my previous mouse. I *highly* recommend using a mouse bungee to keep your cord off the desk because of the weight of the mouse. Otherwise the tiniest bit of drag from the cord can affect your aim or move the mouse.As far as keeping it clean, I use a can of compressed air to blow it out every couple of days because my place is a dust factory. I wear compression gloves so getting oils on the open parts of the mouse aren't an issue, and a simple wipe of the buttons with an alcohol prep pad takes care of the buttons.In terms of playing games until you dial in those CPI settings you may have some issues with your aim, especially if you are doing fast-twitch things like FPS. However being able to create profiles for programs is very useful, even if you have to actually know where your program is located to select the executable file to make one. It does switch seamlessly when you click in and out of programs so there's a definite plus. Unfortunately there aren't any built-in integrations with programs like Discord so you'll have to rely on setting up keys with program hotkeys.The RGB settings aren't the most advanced and a bit difficult to set up in comparison to other devices I've used. If that's super important to you you may not be happy with this, but for me personally I'm not bothered.In summary, it's a good mouse, and if you can pick it up on sale like I did it's well worth it.

The Aerox 5 fits the bill for me.  I am coming from a pedigree of Basic Packard Bell (1990s) -> Microsoft Explorer -> Razer Deathadder -> G502 -> Glorious Model D Wireless -> Aerox 5.While I really enjoyed the Glorious Model D, I immediately missed the extra buttons from my G502.  I adjusted to the reduction in mouse buttons by grabbing a foot pedal for PTT voice comms (similar pedal: https://amzn.to/3VwdEuD) which turned out to be an amazing upgrade.The Model D only lasted a few months before the scroll wheel malfunctioned.  The wheel would randomly scroll causing me to weapon switch during intense left-click firefights. The right click mouse button also started sticking.So, looking for an upgrade, I stumbled upon the Aerox 5.The things that immediately drew me to the Aerox 5 were the 9 programmable buttons. I love that the mouse is an ultra light, weighing only slightly more than the Model D I was upgrading from. The mouse is pretty much perfect in every way, however there are a couple of annoying things I will point out here:1. The dongle is USB-C.  I do not have a USB-C port in my PC, so I was running the dongle with a long USB-A -> USB-C connection... until I stumbled upon the direct plug adapter (2nd pic).  You can get one of those here https://amzn.to/3GmkoH6.  I wish they had included one with the mouse.2. The mouse profiles in the SteelSeries GG software don't reliably automatically switch.  I have different profiles set up for each of my games with different button bindings and while the profile normally switches just fine, it's not 100% reliable.  Easy to fix.  I would recommend just having the 1 default profile and setting the extra mouse buttons to the NUMPAD keys and then change your key bindings in game accordingly. That way you don't have to mess with profile switching.  That's how I'll be setting it up once I reformat and lose these profiles.3. There is no DPI indicator light on the mouse that I can tell.4. The battery life is not the greatest but more than adequate.  It'll last 2 or 3 days before needing a charge.  I normally just connect it back up when I'm done playing and never really notice it.All in all, a great mouse and I highly recommend it.

The left and right mouse buttons were extremely sensitive the first two or three weeks, so I was accidentally clicking frequently when I didn't mean to. It seemed to just be a break-in period because almost 2 months in and it's much better now.My only issue is that the battery life doesn't seem to match the 180+ hour that was marketed, though even the marketing is inconsistent. The listing title states 180+ hours, but the product details states up to 180 hours. If I unplug the mouse to use it wirelessly, it maybe lasts 48-60 hours before it flashes red to indicate it needs to be plugged in. I initially thought it might have just been flashing red as a normal part of it switching colors, until it disconnected several minutes later until I charged it for a while. There's software that lets you turn off the RGB to extend the battery life, but I'd rather play with the RGB, it's just the product details could be a bit more transparent on what we can expect battery life-wise."}

This review will provide an in-depth analysis of the product, highlighting its pros and cons.Pros:  Lightweight Design: The mouse is skeletonized, making it incredibly light. This feature contributes to enhanced maneuverability and reduces fatigue during extended gaming or work sessions. The lightweight nature of the mouse allows for swift and precise movements.  Eye-catching RGB Lights: The RGB lighting on the mouse is visually appealing and adds a touch of flair to your gaming setup. The vibrant colors and effects create an immersive experience, especially in a gaming environment. However, it's worth noting that the aesthetics might not be suitable for a professional work setting.  Thumb Buttons: The mouse boasts five conveniently placed buttons for the thumb. These extra buttons can be customized to suit your needs, providing quick access to macros or other functions. The intuitive placement of these buttons enhances gaming and productivity, allowing for seamless control and efficiency.  Excellent Supporting Software: SteelSeries provides downloadable software that complements the mouse perfectly. This software allows you to customize various aspects of the mouse, including DPI settings, button mapping, and RGB lighting effects. The extensive customization options ensure that the mouse can be tailored to your specific preferences and gaming style.Cons:  Awkwardly Placed Buttons: One notable drawback is that two of the mouse buttons are situated in unconventional locations, making them awkward to use. These buttons require pressing them either upwards or downwards, which can be uncomfortable and disruptive to your grip. As a result, some users, including myself, tend to avoid using these particular buttons altogether.  Gamer Aesthetic: The mouse design clearly leans towards a gamer-centric style. While this may be a positive aspect for gaming enthusiasts, it may not appeal to individuals seeking a more subtle or professional-looking mouse. The aggressive styling and RGB lighting might not blend well with a professional work environment.  Battery Life: The battery life isn't terrible but it's also not great. It does come with a fabric usb cable to charge it and it charges very fast, but the shorter battery life can be annoying if it dies while in use.In conclusion, the SteelSeries mouse offers several impressive features that make it a desirable choice for gamers and enthusiasts. Its lightweight design, customizable thumb buttons, and captivating RGB lighting add value to the overall user experience. Additionally, the supporting software provides extensive customization options.However, it's important to note that the placement of two buttons can be awkward, leading to discomfort and the potential for limited usage. Furthermore, the gamer aesthetic may not be suitable for everyone, especially those seeking a more professional-looking mouse.If you prioritize a lightweight and customizable gaming mouse and appreciate the visual appeal of RGB lighting, this mouse is worth considering. Just be aware of the potential button placement issues and ensure that the gamer-centric design aligns with your preferences and environment."}

Tinkering with the engine settings in the GG app is a must to get your CPI settings right.I really like the button placement, though the 7-8 can be a bit awkward since they are up and down rather than push in. The 9 button is placed a little further out so it prevents accidental presses which was a major problem with my previous mouse. I *highly* recommend using a mouse bungee to keep your cord off the desk because of the weight of the mouse. Otherwise the tiniest bit of drag from the cord can affect your aim or move the mouse.As far as keeping it clean, I use a can of compressed air to blow it out every couple of days because my place is a dust factory. I wear compression gloves so getting oils on the open parts of the mouse aren't an issue, and a simple wipe of the buttons with an alcohol prep pad takes care of the buttons.In terms of playing games until you dial in those CPI settings you may have some issues with your aim, especially if you are doing fast-twitch things like FPS. However being able to create profiles for programs is very useful, even if you have to actually know where your program is located to select the executable file to make one. It does switch seamlessly when you click in and out of programs so there's a definite plus. Unfortunately there aren't any built-in integrations with programs like Discord so you'll have to rely on setting up keys with program hotkeys.The RGB settings aren't the most advanced and a bit difficult to set up in comparison to other devices I've used. If that's super important to you you may not be happy with this, but for me personally I'm not bothered.In summary, it's a good mouse, and if you can pick it up on sale like I did it's well worth it. Keep in mind this is a really light mouse and there will be an adjustment period if you're coming from something heavy. Setting it up with the software takes a bit more know-how than other programs for other brands."}

{"asin": "B09VNTCZZN", "username": "Jon", "title": "1.0 out of 5 stars\nSteelSeries' RMA Process is Atrocious", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023", "purchased": "Style: WirelessPattern Name: Aerox 5", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I used this mouse for work and at home for 4 months. The mouse was great to use for the time that everything worked, but after the 4-month mark I started noticing that the scroll wheel wasn't scrolling in the direction I moved it consistently, and the left mouse button would occasionally register double-clicks when I was only single-clicking.I'm an avid PC user, so I bought this mouse as a replacement for an old SS mouse that was about 1-2 years old that had also started having these problems, as well as a replacement for the ~$10 mice that my workplace provides me whenever the last $10 mouse fails.I've had a lot of SteelSeries gear in the last 10 years, and while the headset and keyboard are still very solid, their mice have gotten significantly worse in terms of quality and reliability within the last 3-5 years.The fact that this mouse didn't last 4 months before it started showing problems already had me a bit shaken, but going to the SS website to ask for a replacement was the rest of the iceberg that I ran aground on that led me to give this 1 star. Upon opening the ticket, the person assisting me apologized that I was experiencing this issue and asked me to make a video recording of the problems with the scroll wheel and left mouse button using a website, and also wanted me to provide a picture of the serial number (even though I'd already provided the serial number with the ticket).I tried using the website provided to test the issue and make the recording, but the indicator that I was supposed to take a recording of on the site wasn't locked in place, so it was impossible to record while testing the scroll wheel.So they gave me a middling website to use to make a \"proof\" video of the specific issue I was having, and so I asked - rather nicely- that they address the issue on their own time and just send me a replacement. I'd already been stuck with a malfunctioning mouse for a month (at this point only ~5 months into owning it), so I didn't feel like leaping over hurdles or jumping through hoops to replace something that had a number of defects.But after doing this everything went south. The next response was a wall-of-text containing their RMA procedure, some legaleese about SS having the right to protect itself from fraudulent claims, further explanation as to why they needed pictures of the unit, the serial number (again), etc.I'd already provided the serial number when I submitted the ticket, as well as a picture of it and proof of purchase with the \"Please diagnose the issue on your own time.\" response. So the legaleese that asked for both of these _again_ was clearly just copy-pasted by the rep and a further waste of my time.So I take a video of the malfunctioning mouse using a different website that could actually be recorded easily, took pictures of all sides of the unit, and gave them everything they asked for - including the items I had already provided. And the next response I got was another massive wall-of-text describing the steps I needed to go to in order for me to DESTROY the mouse before they even committed to an RMA replacement.So this person hadn't provided me with a replacement, or a coupon to be able to purchase a replacement unit through their website yet... but I was supposed to DESTROY the mouse that I still owned and used at home and at work before they sent me a replacement.Excuse me? You need me to destroy the $130 item I bought from you before you before even commit to providing me a replacement? What in the absolute f*** kind of an RMA process is that?After further wasting my time scanning through the legaleese the rep responded with, the \"alternative\" is for me to BUY a new mouse from their website using a code they provide. And if I jump over all their hurdles and through the remainder of their hoops, then they just might refund me for the new mouse.The whole process feels like absolute codswallop. Maybe if they don't renege on their RMA once I have the new mouse I ordered with my own money in hand, I'll come back here and bump this up to 2 stars.Boy, do I sure love a company that makes me waste my time, makes no promises of following through on the RMA, and asks me to either destroy the thing I have or buy a brand new one just to finally have a chance at something that doesn't have defects. Gee, thanks SteelSeries!"}

Great feel to it (claw grip). Great pads, very smooth, switches/scroll wheel feel amazing and it’s light. (Have yet to test battery life). The software gets a 1/10 lol. It’s the worst mouse software I’ve used, between Corsair, Logitech, and even red dragon. Bringing the average overall to a 3. ITS CRAZY, imagine having an amazing product, and the im giving it a 3 over your software? The software is steel series GG. It operates as a game capture software, aim trainer, add platform for their products, etc.. It does everything but be a good mouse software. It constantly runs in the background, even if you turn off game capture/auto clips it still pops up with the overlay in every game. My BIGGEST complaint about it is I have played on 850 dpi my whole life. This is the first mouse EVER that I can’t. Their software dpi editing only operates in 100 increments, so you either could do 800 or 900 but not 850. That may sound crazy to you but when you’ve played on a sensitivity for 17 years, it matter. That reason alone I will be returning it. Last issue that really bothers me, is the rgb settings, for the mouse? You can set them, but it DOESNT EVEN WORK LOL. Very common complaint I have seen here but I thought it may just be intermittently working. Nope it just doesn’t work at all and the rgb does it’s own thing.

This mouse is a nice compromise.  It is extremely light and glides smoothly against any surface.  The buttons are large and comfortable to access.  The shape of the mouse closely resembles Razer Deathader, thus it is very comfortable, and I do like the thumb wedge.  I use the the flick switch as left /right  /strafe in 3D games, which allows me to comfortably play without using the keyboard at all.  I am however worried that given the amount of pressure  applied on the flick switch that it wont last long.  Time will tell.My only problem with this mouse is the non existent  Linux support.  Which requires me to use third party hacks to be able to access the button and RGB  lighting profiles.  However the mouse does have onboard memory and so I am able to reuse my button profile across multiple operating systems.  A custom RGB lighting scheme  still requires background software to run, which I really do not like.One thing that can be easily improved about this mouse is having a  reinforced plastic for the thumb wedge, otherwise the mouse tends to squeak when ever I try put my thumb against it."}

The quality for the price isn't up to par, the battery life is overstated, and the RMA process needs improvement.I felt this mouse was a little over priced compared to the quality I've received from other brands at this price point. I'd compare it to the quality of the Glorious brand mice, which is exactly where this one landed for me.I've been a loyal customer to steel series for some time, partly because I didn't know as much about computer accessories as I do now. From dealing with them over the years, I've noticed a downward trend in quality and customer service all while keeping premium pricing.From the 2 aerox that I've owned, the scroll wheel encoder has been the main issue from what I can tell. When scrolling down or up, the wheel tends to bounce back and forth between directions. This can be frustrating in game when changing camera zoom or weapons, as well as simply surfing the internet. The problem existed from the start with both of them, but I waited until it was completely unbearable to see if RMA'ing would be worth it. This is where the experience really changed my opinion about steel series.In order to process the RMA, they make you jump through various loops with there super generic scripts that are meant to make you feel like they care, all though it's more like they're not even listening. Following all the trouble shooting and submitting the personal info to process an RMA, they then tell you that your RMA is pending but they want you to either destroy the product and send evidence of it destroyed, or pay to send it back to their facility so they can then send you a new unit. This means you'd have to go without a mouse for some time, and potentially dish out money to get a replacement that is likely to show up with the same issue."}

I have, and use daily, an Apex Pro and Arctis Nova Pro. My mouse before this one was an Aerox 5 wired and I really liked that mouse but wanted to ditch the wire. So I figured the wireless version would be perfect and I would love it as much as all the other Steelseries peripherals I have purchased. Unfortunately I was very, very wrong.First off, the positives, of which there are a few. It fits my hand perfectly which I often have a hard time with as my hand tends to be too big for smaller mice but too small for bigger mice. The weight was really good for me too. There are plenty lighter mice but this was right about where I like it to be and the materials feel good as well and not super cheap or flimsy. All the buttons feel good too without feeling squishy.Unfortunately that about does it for the positives, so here come the issues I had with it in the almost 6 months of daily use I've put it through. The battery life is abysmal and borders on false advertising with what they state it is. I had to charge it every day and ended up having to use it plugged in quite often, which obviously completely defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. It's supposed to be better on Bluetooth but that's because it locks a very low polling rate and disables many features available on 2.4g.It would also constantly disconnect or fail to reconnect after going to sleep, which I have found many complaints about from others who have had the misfortune of purchasing this mouse as well. The final straw was the mouse cursor lagging almost like the sensor was cutting out on long sweeps. As of now it's barely usable less than 6 months after purchase so I'm replacing it with a Logitech.I still have a strong affinity for Steelseries but I think I am going to skip their mice until they start making better ones. The wireless Aerox mice seem to be a problem for many who buy them and I haven't seen any comment or even acknowledgment from Steelseries at all, which isn't a good look. Maybe I just got a bad one, which is entirely possible, but I still absolutely cannot recommend this mouse to anyone."}

{"asin": "B0BGJT87N2", "username": "BigDog", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer's best Naga for long-time Logitech G600 users", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023", "purchased": "Size: Naga V2 HyperSpeed", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I will start by saying I haven't actually used this mouse for gaming - as in, I haven't taken advantage of its buttons. That's because I am not playing mouse and keyboard games that require me to fire off many inputs such as an MMO or a MOBA, and most of my gaming is done on a Dualsense controller.Why get an MMO mouse then? Well, the power user community REQUIRES something like this mouse (and other input devices as well). When I use CAT (computer assisted translation) software, I map practically all my hotkeys to the mouse. When I do data entry type tasks, I map all sorts of data scrapping scripts to the buttons. When I write code, I map shortcuts to it. It is the best.I come from a Logitech G600 that developed double clicking, and I swore that, barring it broke (which it did), I would not upgrade because modern options offered nothing worth switching to. I was dead wrong.The sensor is great, the notched / free spinning wheel is great, it is light (coming from a Logitech G600), and it glides smoothly. Razer's software is of course bad, and so is Logitech's software. But perhaps the most egregious fault of its software (and design of the Naga lineup) is that Hypershift is for all intents and purposes useless.Hypershift is like Logitech's Shift and as the name would imply, it means that one button has a normal binding and a shift binding. So Button 1 can perform two actions. Why is it useless? Because it is a light (comparatively) mouse with a cluster of small buttons you operate with your thumb, so how on earth are you supposed to hold one button and press another? Makes no sense. The most sensible solution would be software-side, making an hypershift toggle, but it is not there. Logitech's G600 has a ring finger exclusively dedicated to being a shift button (though you can also remap it to something else) and so avoids this issue.It is not a big deal for me, as I hardly used shift in my previous G600 because it puts far too much stress in my fingers. I map the thumb pad to extra Fn keys such as F13-F25 and write scripts in AHK, which completely dwarfs ANYTHING Razer's or Logitech's software could so since there are endless combinations (shift, alt, ctrl, windows key, plus combinations of the previous, plus one of the Fn keys) but I believe Razer should still make a toggle function for Hypershift so that it is not silly.Oh, and the battery requirement is a plus. Hands down. I have 4 rechargeable white eneloops and I change batteries like every 2 to 3 weeks. Better than momentarily plugging my mouse and goes well with my wireless Keychron keyboard."}
{"asin": "B0BGJT87N2", "username": "Frosthaven", "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\nGood mouse with a few unfortunate truths", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023", "purchased": "Size: Naga V2 Pro", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I've been using MMO mice for years to play MMOs and up my productivity in the developer/designer space. I have used just about every mouse under the sun in this niche. Logitech G600, The original Naga, Corsair Scimitar Pro, Corsair Scimitar Elite, Aerox 9, and 6-7 other lesser known brands.This is the second time I've dealt with Razer's products. The first was the original 2009 release of the Naga. A mouse I had to replace 6 times in 3 years. I baby my equipment and so I swore them off after that, moving to the G600 in 2012. I still have that G600 and it still works today in 2023.Firstly, this space is seriously lacking decent modern options. Everything is a trade-off and there are no \"winners\".-----Compared to the Aerox 9:The Naga offers a much better (read: not a mile long) shape for 99% of people. The side buttons are also well within reach, unlike the SteelSeries design choice to make the buttons impossible to reach without re-gripping the moment you need 1,2,3 (or 4,5,6 as well for small/medium small hands). This is incredibly sad as the Naga is one of the heaviest MMO mice and you are going to feel it the moment you wrongly attempt to use it for anything that requires fast hand movements. The final comparison I'll draw here is that the Naga buttons are way more comfortable to spam presses on. While your wrist will hate you if you use it for the wrong games, your thumb will love you for not wearing out on harder to push buttons as come standard on the Aerox. Another sticking point with the Aerox is that the button actuation is just hard enough that activating the side buttons will often cause the lightweight body to shift if you aren't death gripping it. This is not a problem with the Naga.-----Compared to the Corsair Scimitar:We get wireless and don't have to deal with iCue. However, Razer Synapse is a rats nest of bugs and you are sure to run into issues the moment you try to do anything beyond using it as-is (definitely expect profile swapping and rgb issues). We also get a scroll wheel that feels slightly less spongy than the Scimitar (once configured). This isn't a free-spin scroll wheel, and certainly is nowhere near the crisp clean feeling of mice like the Logitech G Pro superlight, but it is an improvement against the Scimitar at least. Technically impressive, but only marginally improved from mice a third of it's price point.-----Compared to the Logitech G600:We get much more satisfying clicks and wireless. The G600 is beginning to really show it's age with the spongey side buttons and incredibly old internal tech. In addition, the Logitech team have begun spitting their newer G600s off the line with more budget internals leading to QC issues in the year of this review.-----Final Word:To speak more directly on the Naga v2 pro, it is hard to justify it. The Naga X and hyperspeed offer much better weight. This mouse is priced like a Porsche but drives like a Civic with a tail light out. It is however a \"good enough\" mouse that is held back by its pricing point, gimmicky scroll-wheel tech that isn't quite there yet, and insanely bad software stack.The problem right now is that until a wireless low-weight G600 blesses us in this space, Razer is one of the best out of a lot of really bad choices. So while I would tell prospective buyers to think twice on what they really need from an MMO mouse before taking out a mortgage to buy into Razer, I must begrudgingly add this as one of the best options until something better comes along."}

I don't know what happened to Logitech, but they are just plain crap now.  I swore by the G602 and it's software until it developed the dreaded double click, so I replaced it with another G602 which also developed the double click.  I replaced that with the G604, who's software wasn't nearly as intuitive as the 602, but even that developed the the double click less than a month later.So here I am $179 later with my first Razer product and a bag of hope and optimism. It's only been a day so it's too soon to tell if it'll develop double click issues, but it's supposed to optical switches instead of mechanical which is supposed to prevent the double click issue, but we'll see.  Software side, the Razer Synapse software is miles ahead of the Logitech G Hub software and so much easier to use and makes creating profiles for the mouse much easier than it was with my G604.  Auto profile switching, dpi sensitivity, full button reassignment; it's all here.  What actually surprised me was the customizable scroll wheel tension/clicks per turn,  which I didn't know was something I'd care about until started messing with it. The fact that it can do such a thing actually blows my mind a little.  I probably still have a lot to learn and setup with this but so far it definitely gives a good first impression.  If I don't update this in the future, you can assume that it has not developed any double click issues."}

To this extent, it works great. That said, I think a 6 button mouse like the Logitech G604 would be just as good, but cheaper. I wondered how having 12 side buttons would work, and for me I think it's too many. It isn't just that the 12 button faceplate has rubber buttons while the 6 button plate has harder plastic ones that feel better to me. The adjustable scroll wheel is interesting, and I'm sure somebody could probably find a use case for it. That said, I'd rather have true infinity scroll than just smooth scroll, but it's not that big of a deal. If it is for you, the cheaper Naga V2 HyperSpeed may be better. It has a nice feel for those with large hands who like to palm grip. Thus far, it isn't surprising that this isn't supported in Linux via Open Razer given how new it is as of now. I have not experienced issues with profiles not being stored correctly that some have. Maybe it's just a driver update issue. It does have issues with the RGB mode not syncing properly after the screen saver comes on sometimes. However unplugging and replugging it in will fix it until it happens again. No idea how the wireless works as I prefer to leave it plugged in. That said, I've never noticed latency issues. Only thing I'd change would be to have perhaps one button on the right side of the mouse to assign as the Hypershift function. Reassigning it to middle scroll wheel click works ok, but can sometimes accidentally left or right scroll wheel click."}

Chiefly, I like the Razer brand because they do not use Corsair's iCue software for controlling the RGB LED lights, and second, I wanted a mouse with multiple buttons for use in 3D modeling.At the onset, the 12-button interface really got my interest, but also being able to change the button interface with two other options, a 6 and 3 button interface also made it a potential winner. The idea of being able to program more than 3 macros on a mouse for the tools I use regularly in my 3D program was my primary goal.The mouse I was using before this purchase, also a Razer mouse, only offers 3 additional buttons, and although the lighting effects are cool, when your hand is on it, who cares? But that's just my opinion. It does, however, look cool when it's not being used. I will admit that.After unboxing the new Razer Naga V2 Pro, I went immediately with the 12-button interface, but within minutes, I kept accidentally pressing buttons. It turns out that the nifty thumb shelf that is built into my Razer Basilisk Pro is a non-existent on the Naga V2 Pro. The spot your thumb regularly rests, on the Naga, it's all buttons, and gripping the mouse to move it proved very difficult. So, I installed the 6-button interface to see if that would remedy the issue. At this point, I'm disappointed.Unfortunately, my disappointment grew as I discovered that the 6-button interface is not back lit like the 12-button interface is. WHAT!? Are you serious? Why would the product designers/engineers back light the 12-button interface but not back light the 6-button interface? Why bother? And guess what? The 3-button interface is also not back lit. Razer didn't even like paint or decal the buttons, and they're numbered, but you can't see the numbers.After using the Naga V2 Pro for a day, changing between the very cool 12-button interface to the 6, I found myself going back to my Basilik Pro. That thumb rest is actually really important to me. Never underestimate ergonomics!In summary, to me, in my opinion, Razer's Naga V2 Pro is just short of very good. There's also very little lighting effects, which is sort of one of the selling points of a Razer mouse. And as to the question of why back light one interface and not the others is... well, makes no sense to me at all!So, it's a fail. And at the price point, I will be requesting a refund.  I just wish that Razer's designers would go that extra step and consider every angle before going for launch."}

Additionally the numbers on the 6 button attachment increase in number horizontally... I'm not sure why but doing it vertically makes way more sense to me. Considering that the keys do not even light up, I feel like they should be numberless and allow us to number each button ourselves in the software.That being said, in Diablo, it is no big deal as I am able to reorder the skills at will. If it was not for that I would probably return the mouse.TL;DR - Great mouse if you are looking for something like this. But come on Logitech, its about time you updated the G600 and made it wireless and compatible with power with similar attachments like the Naga!!"}

I play a variety of games, so I was really excited to be able to have 3 different side button layouts to choose from without needing to have 3 different gaming mice, for example I will only use the 2-button side panel for FPS games because in the middle of combat you can't really use any more than 2.Next, the customizable scroll wheel is a feature I am loving, I hope razer adds this to their other mouse because honestly its game changing, maybe its not the most \"gaming\" feature but it certainly is a game changer for productivity, there is a setting in synapse to activate smooth scrolling whenever you are actively using a browser and automatically switches back to default when using other applications. This saves a bunch of effort in needing to press a button to switch between different scrolls settings.Another feature I absolutely love would be the customizability of the scroll wheel, this mouse has by far the best scroll wheel out there, even better than whatever Logitech has simply because you can alter everything about it, how much force it takes to spin the scroll wheel, how many steps does the scroll wheel (into single digit increments, Ie, 24 steps, to 25 steps), even change how these change over time so you can make it so that the scroll wheel needs a force of 75 to start but as you scroll faster it will drop to 40, etc...Battery life is also a non-issue, I see people complain about why you would need a QI charging capable mouse (which is sold separately btw)? people forget this mouse has both 2.4 and Bluetooth connection so if you are traveling you can easily charge this on a wireless charger, or people forget the dock that razer had been using often failed to make proper contact because of dirt buildup, making it wirelessly charge is the obvious solution.Now this mouse is not without issues, for one it is a ridiculously heavy mouse by today's standards. Personally, I'm not too bothered by it because i use this mouse for both gaming and productivity, if you are a FPS competitive player i would not buy this mouse. another issue is the price, this is an expensive mouse but it is packed with razer's latest tech so I guess I can't fault it entirely."}
{"asin": "B0BGJT87N2", "username": "BigDog", "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nRazer's best Naga for long-time Logitech G600 users", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023", "purchased": "Size: Naga V2 HyperSpeed", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I will start by saying I haven't actually used this mouse for gaming - as in, I haven't taken advantage of its buttons. That's because I am not playing mouse and keyboard games that require me to fire off many inputs such as an MMO or a MOBA, and most of my gaming is done on a Dualsense controller.Why get an MMO mouse then? Well, the power user community REQUIRES something like this mouse (and other input devices as well). When I use CAT (computer assisted translation) software, I map practically all my hotkeys to the mouse. When I do data entry type tasks, I map all sorts of data scrapping scripts to the buttons. When I write code, I map shortcuts to it. It is the best.I come from a Logitech G600 that developed double clicking, and I swore that, barring it broke (which it did), I would not upgrade because modern options offered nothing worth switching to. I was dead wrong.The sensor is great, the notched / free spinning wheel is great, it is light (coming from a Logitech G600), and it glides smoothly. Razer's software is of course bad, and so is Logitech's software. But perhaps the most egregious fault of its software (and design of the Naga lineup) is that Hypershift is for all intents and purposes useless.Hypershift is like Logitech's Shift and as the name would imply, it means that one button has a normal binding and a shift binding. So Button 1 can perform two actions. Why is it useless? Because it is a light (comparatively) mouse with a cluster of small buttons you operate with your thumb, so how on earth are you supposed to hold one button and press another? Makes no sense. The most sensible solution would be software-side, making an hypershift toggle, but it is not there. Logitech's G600 has a ring finger exclusively dedicated to being a shift button (though you can also remap it to something else) and so avoids this issue.It is not a big deal for me, as I hardly used shift in my previous G600 because it puts far too much stress in my fingers. I map the thumb pad to extra Fn keys such as F13-F25 and write scripts in AHK, which completely dwarfs ANYTHING Razer's or Logitech's software could so since there are endless combinations (shift, alt, ctrl, windows key, plus combinations of the previous, plus one of the Fn keys) but I believe Razer should still make a toggle function for Hypershift so that it is not silly.Oh, and the battery requirement is a plus. Hands down. I have 4 rechargeable white eneloops and I change batteries like every 2 to 3 weeks. Better than momentarily plugging my mouse and goes well with my wireless Keychron keyboard."}
{"asin": "B0BGJT87N2", "username": "Frosthaven", "title": "3.0 out of 5 stars\nGood mouse with a few unfortunate truths", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023", "purchased": "Size: Naga V2 Pro", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I've been using MMO mice for years to play MMOs and up my productivity in the developer/designer space. I have used just about every mouse under the sun in this niche. Logitech G600, The original Naga, Corsair Scimitar Pro, Corsair Scimitar Elite, Aerox 9, and 6-7 other lesser known brands.This is the second time I've dealt with Razer's products. The first was the original 2009 release of the Naga. A mouse I had to replace 6 times in 3 years. I baby my equipment and so I swore them off after that, moving to the G600 in 2012. I still have that G600 and it still works today in 2023.Firstly, this space is seriously lacking decent modern options. Everything is a trade-off and there are no \"winners\".-----Compared to the Aerox 9:The Naga offers a much better (read: not a mile long) shape for 99% of people. The side buttons are also well within reach, unlike the SteelSeries design choice to make the buttons impossible to reach without re-gripping the moment you need 1,2,3 (or 4,5,6 as well for small/medium small hands). This is incredibly sad as the Naga is one of the heaviest MMO mice and you are going to feel it the moment you wrongly attempt to use it for anything that requires fast hand movements. The final comparison I'll draw here is that the Naga buttons are way more comfortable to spam presses on. While your wrist will hate you if you use it for the wrong games, your thumb will love you for not wearing out on harder to push buttons as come standard on the Aerox. Another sticking point with the Aerox is that the button actuation is just hard enough that activating the side buttons will often cause the lightweight body to shift if you aren't death gripping it. This is not a problem with the Naga.-----Compared to the Corsair Scimitar:We get wireless and don't have to deal with iCue. However, Razer Synapse is a rats nest of bugs and you are sure to run into issues the moment you try to do anything beyond using it as-is (definitely expect profile swapping and rgb issues). We also get a scroll wheel that feels slightly less spongy than the Scimitar (once configured). This isn't a free-spin scroll wheel, and certainly is nowhere near the crisp clean feeling of mice like the Logitech G Pro superlight, but it is an improvement against the Scimitar at least. Technically impressive, but only marginally improved from mice a third of it's price point.-----Compared to the Logitech G600:We get much more satisfying clicks and wireless. The G600 is beginning to really show it's age with the spongey side buttons and incredibly old internal tech. In addition, the Logitech team have begun spitting their newer G600s off the line with more budget internals leading to QC issues in the year of this review.-----Final Word:To speak more directly on the Naga v2 pro, it is hard to justify it. The Naga X and hyperspeed offer much better weight. This mouse is priced like a Porsche but drives like a Civic with a tail light out. It is however a \"good enough\" mouse that is held back by its pricing point, gimmicky scroll-wheel tech that isn't quite there yet, and insanely bad software stack.The problem right now is that until a wireless low-weight G600 blesses us in this space, Razer is one of the best out of a lot of really bad choices. So while I would tell prospective buyers to think twice on what they really need from an MMO mouse before taking out a mortgage to buy into Razer, I must begrudgingly add this as one of the best options until something better comes along."}

I don't know what happened to Logitech, but they are just plain crap now.  I swore by the G602 and it's software until it developed the dreaded double click, so I replaced it with another G602 which also developed the double click.  I replaced that with the G604, who's software wasn't nearly as intuitive as the 602, but even that developed the the double click less than a month later.So here I am $179 later with my first Razer product and a bag of hope and optimism. It's only been a day so it's too soon to tell if it'll develop double click issues, but it's supposed to optical switches instead of mechanical which is supposed to prevent the double click issue, but we'll see.  Software side, the Razer Synapse software is miles ahead of the Logitech G Hub software and so much easier to use and makes creating profiles for the mouse much easier than it was with my G604.  Auto profile switching, dpi sensitivity, full button reassignment; it's all here.  What actually surprised me was the customizable scroll wheel tension/clicks per turn,  which I didn't know was something I'd care about until started messing with it. The fact that it can do such a thing actually blows my mind a little.  I probably still have a lot to learn and setup with this but so far it definitely gives a good first impression.  If I don't update this in the future, you can assume that it has not developed any double click issues."}

To this extent, it works great. That said, I think a 6 button mouse like the Logitech G604 would be just as good, but cheaper. I wondered how having 12 side buttons would work, and for me I think it's too many. It isn't just that the 12 button faceplate has rubber buttons while the 6 button plate has harder plastic ones that feel better to me. The adjustable scroll wheel is interesting, and I'm sure somebody could probably find a use case for it. That said, I'd rather have true infinity scroll than just smooth scroll, but it's not that big of a deal. If it is for you, the cheaper Naga V2 HyperSpeed may be better. It has a nice feel for those with large hands who like to palm grip. Thus far, it isn't surprising that this isn't supported in Linux via Open Razer given how new it is as of now. I have not experienced issues with profiles not being stored correctly that some have. Maybe it's just a driver update issue. It does have issues with the RGB mode not syncing properly after the screen saver comes on sometimes. However unplugging and replugging it in will fix it until it happens again. No idea how the wireless works as I prefer to leave it plugged in. That said, I've never noticed latency issues. Only thing I'd change would be to have perhaps one button on the right side of the mouse to assign as the Hypershift function. Reassigning it to middle scroll wheel click works ok, but can sometimes accidentally left or right scroll wheel click."}

Chiefly, I like the Razer brand because they do not use Corsair's iCue software for controlling the RGB LED lights, and second, I wanted a mouse with multiple buttons for use in 3D modeling.At the onset, the 12-button interface really got my interest, but also being able to change the button interface with two other options, a 6 and 3 button interface also made it a potential winner. The idea of being able to program more than 3 macros on a mouse for the tools I use regularly in my 3D program was my primary goal.The mouse I was using before this purchase, also a Razer mouse, only offers 3 additional buttons, and although the lighting effects are cool, when your hand is on it, who cares? But that's just my opinion. It does, however, look cool when it's not being used. I will admit that.After unboxing the new Razer Naga V2 Pro, I went immediately with the 12-button interface, but within minutes, I kept accidentally pressing buttons. It turns out that the nifty thumb shelf that is built into my Razer Basilisk Pro is a non-existent on the Naga V2 Pro. The spot your thumb regularly rests, on the Naga, it's all buttons, and gripping the mouse to move it proved very difficult. So, I installed the 6-button interface to see if that would remedy the issue. At this point, I'm disappointed.Unfortunately, my disappointment grew as I discovered that the 6-button interface is not back lit like the 12-button interface is. WHAT!? Are you serious? Why would the product designers/engineers back light the 12-button interface but not back light the 6-button interface? Why bother? And guess what? The 3-button interface is also not back lit. Razer didn't even like paint or decal the buttons, and they're numbered, but you can't see the numbers.After using the Naga V2 Pro for a day, changing between the very cool 12-button interface to the 6, I found myself going back to my Basilik Pro. That thumb rest is actually really important to me. Never underestimate ergonomics!In summary, to me, in my opinion, Razer's Naga V2 Pro is just short of very good. There's also very little lighting effects, which is sort of one of the selling points of a Razer mouse. And as to the question of why back light one interface and not the others is... well, makes no sense to me at all!So, it's a fail. And at the price point, I will be requesting a refund.  I just wish that Razer's designers would go that extra step and consider every angle before going for launch."}

Battery life is greatly extended by the fact that the mouse turns itself off readily anytime that thinks it needs to which can be very minorly inconvenient as you wake it back up but usually not a problem.When you take the top lid off of it in order to put batteries in or remove/stow the USB radio as you replace the top lid and try to seat it sometimes you have to press firmly in order to get the left and right mouse buttons to click back into place - or at least I do on mine. Hopefully this does not become a problem over time but so far it has not.For people who were a fan of older razor Naga mice you can find that this mouse once again has a return of the upper left corner left pair of buttons.

I am upgrading directly from a Razer Naga V1 Pro.Thumb Grid: Feels about the same as the Razer Naga V1 Pro. No complaints.Left & Right Buttons: Slightly snappier than my Naga V1 Pro, with a clean binary click; all on/all off as it should be. My V1 has a little give when you start pressing the buttons before actuating, feeling almost like a three-stage clicking mechanism. I am pretty sure this was a defect of my V1 Pro, so the fact the V2 doesn't have this is an improvement.Middle Wheel (Press): The current mouse scroll setting has a large impact on the stability of the middle mouse click. Smooth scroll and lesser tensions can make it feel a bit wiggly.Middle Wheel (Scroll): The meat & potatoes of the new mouse for my use case. It is extremely hit or miss and is underbaked in both development and support. While it is great to customize the feel of the scroll wheel, the software significantly limits the capability by only offering one slot for Custom settings.The setup for Tension & Degree of Rotation takes some time to get used to, but it should not take more than 30 minutes to dial in an \"ideal\" setting. I put ideal in quotes as no setting -- Standard, Ultra-fine, Smooth scroll, Custom, etc -- are what I would consider great.My largest complaint with the scroll is the disconnect between the scroll tension 'notches' and the actual output. While slowly scrolling, occasionally you'll feel the bump on the wheel, but no scroll action is sent to the computer. I have tested and confirmed this issue on three separate machines, using Custom and Standard/Ultra-fine wheel stages. I believe this may be a physical limitation due to the way the new scroll wheel is constructed to allow for such high customization. I much prefer another brands scroll-wheel in their productivity focused mice.30K Sensor: No use case where it presented itself as an advantage. The mouse has precise tracking as previous generations did.Battery Life: Too soon to tell; will update this review down the road.Software: Other than the scroll wheel settings above, Synapse still has a long way to go. Please add the ability to have device battery statuses (percentages) displayed in the taskbar. It would be great if I could assign a battery level color to the main Razer logo on the top of the mouse as well.Weight: Absolutely chonky. There is no universe where I would feel comfortable using this mouse for anything other than MMO's and office work.

Battery life is greatly extended by the fact that the mouse turns itself off readily anytime that thinks it needs to which can be very minorly inconvenient as you wake it back up but usually not a problem.When you take the top lid off of it in order to put batteries in or remove/stow the USB radio as you replace the top lid and try to seat it sometimes you have to press firmly in order to get the left and right mouse buttons to click back into place - or at least I do on mine. Hopefully this does not become a problem over time but so far it has not.For people who were a fan of older razor Naga mice you can find that this mouse once again has a return of the upper left corner left pair of buttons.  Sadly there don't seem to be any wired mice that currently offer these so this is possibly the only option you have unless I missed something.That said I've been using razor mice for quite some time and if you spend a lot of time at the computer you'll typically get somewhere between 3 to 4 years on razor naga mice so long as you don't beat them up too badly playing dance of fire and Ice like I did on my last one.If you have a problem within your warranty. Contact razor support for a replacement. They've been quite reasonable to me in the past when I've needed to."}

I am upgrading directly from a Razer Naga V1 Pro.Thumb Grid: Feels about the same as the Razer Naga V1 Pro. No complaints.Left & Right Buttons: Slightly snappier than my Naga V1 Pro, with a clean binary click; all on/all off as it should be. My V1 has a little give when you start pressing the buttons before actuating, feeling almost like a three-stage clicking mechanism. I am pretty sure this was a defect of my V1 Pro, so the fact the V2 doesn't have this is an improvement.Middle Wheel (Press): The current mouse scroll setting has a large impact on the stability of the middle mouse click. Smooth scroll and lesser tensions can make it feel a bit wiggly.Middle Wheel (Scroll): The meat & potatoes of the new mouse for my use case. It is extremely hit or miss and is underbaked in both development and support. While it is great to customize the feel of the scroll wheel, the software significantly limits the capability by only offering one slot for Custom settings.The setup for Tension & Degree of Rotation takes some time to get used to, but it should not take more than 30 minutes to dial in an \"ideal\" setting. I put ideal in quotes as no setting -- Standard, Ultra-fine, Smooth scroll, Custom, etc -- are what I would consider great.My largest complaint with the scroll is the disconnect between the scroll tension 'notches' and the actual output. While slowly scrolling, occasionally you'll feel the bump on the wheel, but no scroll action is sent to the computer. I have tested and confirmed this issue on three separate machines, using Custom and Standard/Ultra-fine wheel stages. I believe this may be a physical limitation due to the way the new scroll wheel is constructed to allow for such high customization. I much prefer another brands scroll-wheel in their productivity focused mice.30K Sensor: No use case where it presented itself as an advantage. The mouse has precise tracking as previous generations did.Battery Life: Too soon to tell; will update this review down the road.Software: Other than the scroll wheel settings above, Synapse still has a long way to go. Please add the ability to have device battery statuses (percentages) displayed in the taskbar. It would be great if I could assign a battery level color to the main Razer logo on the top of the mouse as well.Weight: Absolutely chonky. There is no universe where I would feel comfortable using this mouse for anything other than MMO's and office work. It can become tiring over long stretches of activity, which does not bode well for a mouse catering to the MMO audience, and also sports multiple side plate options for genres where it is sub-optimal in performance.Charging: I purchased a used 'Like-New' charging puck off of Amazon Warehouse and am using a pre-existing Quick Charge 3.0 Qi wireless pad. Thankfully they work great, so you can avoid the ridiculous price of the official offerings.Price: $179 at the time of this review is unmerited. The performance is on a similar level to the V1 Pro with some new annoyances and for most users, I would recommend the wired Razer Naga X or wireless Hyperspeed variants."}

Which is great... until it turns into a brick. And coupling that with a frustrating Amazon/Razer RMA return experience, I'm done with the brand just based on my experience with THIS mouse.First purchase from Razer in last year of 2022 in August was this mouse, based on the recommendation of a friend. Worked great just over a month, then I started getting usb overvolt warnings on my PC (with no changes/issues with other devices) and even after I unplugged EVERYTHING except for the mouse on my computer... apparently the damage was done. Tried to return it, Amazon refused because though it was purchased through Razer's official Amazon store, the order was fulfilled through a third party company and the third party company (after many emails) told me sorry, they couldn't do anything for me, I'd have to talk with the manufacturer. Talked to Razer and they told me that the best they could do was send me a replacement (if they determined that the unit WAS in fact faulty) and that it'd probably take 4-6 weeks for that to be determined (leaving me without a mouse) and I'd have to pay shipping. So that was pretty lame.After using my old mouse for another month or so and talking with a friend, I decided to chalk up the first one to bad manufacturing/random issues and buy another one.

Went through all the fun troubleshooting tips I learned in the first go round... nothing. Tested it on a mac laptop + another pc. Nothing. Just DEAD.  So here I am.If you have the budget to spend $30-50 (depending on current price) every 3 months on a mouse and like the ultralight/small size of the Razer Viper Mini, I HIGHLY recommend it. When it works, it was probably the BEST mouse I've ever owned. But this durability issue has completely turned me off their products in general, despite this particular one seemingly having great reviews. Your mileage may vary, obviously."}

Which is great... until it turns into a brick. And coupling that with a frustrating Amazon/Razer RMA return experience, I'm done with the brand just based on my experience with THIS mouse.First purchase from Razer in last year of 2022 in August was this mouse, based on the recommendation of a friend. Worked great just over a month, then I started getting usb overvolt warnings on my PC (with no changes/issues with other devices) and even after I unplugged EVERYTHING except for the mouse on my computer... apparently the damage was done. Tried to return it, Amazon refused because though it was purchased through Razer's official Amazon store, the order was fulfilled through a third party company and the third party company (after many emails) told me sorry, they couldn't do anything for me, I'd have to talk with the manufacturer. Talked to Razer and they told me that the best they could do was send me a replacement (if they determined that the unit WAS in fact faulty) and that it'd probably take 4-6 weeks for that to be determined (leaving me without a mouse) and I'd have to pay shipping. So that was pretty lame.After using my old mouse for another month or so and talking with a friend, I decided to chalk up the first one to bad manufacturing/random issues and buy another one. Got it, worked great for 4 months... and this morning, woke up to my computer powered off and the mouse unresponsive. Went through all the fun troubleshooting tips I learned in the first go round... nothing. Tested it on a mac laptop + another pc. Nothing. Just DEAD.

Once I changed to the larger E-YOOSO mouse, I can honestly say I will never go back! It comfortably accommodates my large hands, allowing for a natural grip and reducing strain during extended use. The contoured shape and smooth matte finish provide a pleasant tactile experience, enhancing both comfort and control.The adjustable DPI (dots per inch) settings are a noteworthy feature of this mouse. With five levels of sensitivity up to 4800 DPI, I can easily tailor the cursor speed to my preference and the task at hand. Whether I'm working on precise graphic design projects or navigating through documents, the flexibility to adjust DPI settings proves invaluable.The six programmable buttons offer convenient customization options, allowing me to assign specific functions or shortcuts according to my workflow.

The buttons are responsive and have a satisfying click, providing a tactile feedback that adds to the overall user experience.However, I have experienced some occasional issues in the past when using this mouse with a docking station. There were moments of delay and inconsistency in its performance, which were not present when using it directly connected to my device. While this hasn't been a major inconvenience for me, it's worth noting for those who rely heavily on docking stations for their setup.In conclusion, despite the occasional issues with docking station compatibility, the E-YOOSO Large Wireless Mouse remains a delightful addition to my computing setup.

The first impression from opening the package and seeing the damaged box  is very bad."}

It would flash, then when you see it rapid flash then you could use it.  I thought it because i had something setup wrong (I upgraded my hard drive and motherboard at the same time getting this mouse). Yesterday the mouse did not flash, thought the battery was dead, replaced the battery and still did not power on at all.  Looked today and discovered lasted day to return was yesterday.  Grabbed my wireless mouse from my laptop and works great.  Sadly it was the mouse the whole time.  Once the mouse connected I was very happy with the performance and feel.  Not sure I will buy another one.Update to my review: I did not notice the mouse has a 12 month warranty.  Thanks to PJ US, they read this review and reached out to me offering a full refund or replacement.  I got a replacement and after testing it for a few days, the new one works great.  I am very happy with the performance and the feel. I highly recommend this mouse and thanks to PJ US for great customer service."}

But I have extra - large hands. Thus the 4 star review. I make it work for me BUT if this company would make an X-31 for extra-large hands, I would buy it in a heartbeat. And please make the pinky rest as wide as the thumb rest. That would make it perfect.Thank you for a well-thought out design."}

Just what I was looking for to ease the pain of \"mouse claw\" from holding onto a small mouse. ( my next step will be an upright ergonomic mouse to help with carpal tunnel issues, i fear!) Buttons are nicely tactile-- not loud, but they do Click. Scroll wheel has a slight bumpiness to it, scrolls well and the dpi is adjustable. The cursor is very accurate and easy to aim, plus works well on a variety of surfaces.Batteries last well, mouse goes to sleep to save battery and is easily woken with a Click.Great bargain at the price I paid."}

Why do so now one may ask? The answer is simple. This mouse is the BOMB! I don’t think I’ll be able to use another mouse ever. I’m considering buying another one for my desktop. I like that it’s big and can accommodate by big hands. I also like the forward and back buttons, which make it easy to move back and forth (i.e., last visited page, etc). I’m not sure about the battery life since I just received it, but I’ll come back to update my review accordingly.UpdateAfter using the mouse(i have two of them now) for almost a month now, everyday, I can say with certainty that this is by far the best mouse I’ve own. I would definitely recommend to fiends and family."}

I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.It was a little more heavier than my previous mouse but the adjustment wasn’t bad. The colors are vibrant and nice (although I only stuck with one) but the customization is great too.The two side buttons do not feel sturdy at all. I have small hands with a mostly light touch but even at times it feels awkward and almost like I’d break one. Could just be my model I’m not sure.The cord length is perfect for my setup since my pc is on my desk but I can understand why some would say the cord is too short if they needed to connect it below the desk. It definitely wouldn’t reach.As for gaming I play a lot of fps so having a reliable mouse is necessary. At first there was a delay or I’d have to click twice but that lasted maybe 3 hours and then afterwards it was as if it never happened. It does track well for me and it’s as good as my reflexes are lol.The overall feeling of the mouse is nice. Honestly for being a cheaper mouse it’s quite good. Admittedly, I bought it just to get a quick mouse that was white and then planned to buy another but I’ve grown attached to this mouse for the moment so I’ll probably use it for awhile now.

I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.It was a little more heavier than my previous mouse but the adjustment wasn’t bad. The colors are vibrant and nice (although I only stuck with one) but the customization is great too.The two side buttons do not feel sturdy at all. I have small hands with a mostly light touch but even at times it feels awkward and almost like I’d break one. Could just be my model I’m not sure.The cord length is perfect for my setup since my pc is on my desk but I can understand why some would say the cord is too short if they needed to connect it below the desk. It definitely wouldn’t reach.As for gaming I play a lot of fps so having a reliable mouse is necessary. At first there was a delay or I’d have to click twice but that lasted maybe 3 hours and then afterwards it was as if it never happened. It does track well for me and it’s as good as my reflexes are lol.The overall feeling of the mouse is nice. Honestly for being a cheaper mouse it’s quite good. Admittedly, I bought it just to get a quick mouse that was white and then planned to buy another but I’ve grown attached to this mouse for the moment so I’ll probably use it for awhile now. After all, it points and clicks and gets the job done all while looking pretty awesome."}

If you want a specific DPI then you're stuck with the predetermined color, and if you want a specific color you're stuck with the predetermined DPI. I'm not sure if this can be configured with the software but I have no intentions of installing it to find out. You cannot freely change the colors or have it cycle.The mouse is also an awkward size - a little too short and low for palm gripping unless you have small hands, but still suitable for claw grip if that's your preference. It is also heavier than I expected - compared to my razer deathadder v2, this mouse is smaller, heavier, and doesn't glide as well (although the gliding might improve after a period of break in). Be sure to remove the plastic film from the feet prior to use.Also, this is an optical mouse which I haven't seen in years, meaning that it uses a visible, blinking red light for tracking, whereas most modern mice are laser mice which use an invisible laser for much more accurate tracking.Overall a low quality product and not worth $20."}

The buttons aren't mushy, The wheel is easy to work with the right amount of \"clicks\" to it to make it feel like it's just not free spinning as you scroll and it has JUST enough weight and build quality that gives it a \"punching over it's 20 buck price tag\" feel.Where it fails is the software. I installed the \"drivers\" from the link provided in the description but it never sees the mouse! I keep getting \"No mouse connected\" message and I have tried EVERY USB port on my computer! Maybe due to windows 11?Not that this is a HUGE deal but I was hoping to use it change the color of my preferred DPI, program buttons and see if there is an option to turn off the default breathing effect.So, my 3 start is based on initial impression of the hardware, with deductions due to the software. Ultimately, if you don't care about the software, this would be a fairly solid mouse I think and I say give it a go. If you are looking to have that software to customize the experience: Look elsewhere.For me, this mouse will be returned and I will give a Red Dragon a go since it's in the same 20 buck price point. If that doesn't pan out I'm thinking I just go with the DeathAdder Essential."}

The DPI on this mouse only goes up to 2400, but that’s plenty for the above average gamer. Unless you are a professional gamer or take your shooters way too seriously, this mouse should work just fine for you.While the mouse works perfectly fine on Mac, you are out of luck for programming this mouse with the Ajazz software on that platform.As for function, the mouse feels comfortable. Even though I have large hands, it seems easy to use. I don’t find myself accidentally clicking the DPI controls when using it. I can easily switch from the primary button to the scroll. The mouse moves around the surface gracefully so I don’t think it will ever trip up and get me killed in a game. The cable is 5ft in length which is plenty long. If you need something longer, get a wireless mouse.I noticed some other reviews mentioning the weight being in the back, but this is incorrect. This mouse seems to be weighted somewhere between the back third and middle third on the length. It can’t be more than a few ounces different.Aesthetically, I wasn’t sure I would like a white mouse, but it actually looks a lot nicer in person. Ajazz took full advantage of the real estate to give you the full experience of the RGB colors. The colors have a slow pulse as well which adds to the experience.I played some games and gave the mouse a try and it seemed to function just fine.I like the mouse but would love to be able to program it on Mac. Please update your software. I would give it a better rating if it had Mac compatible software."}

But this one has some sort of cloth fabric sheath its closest comparison i can say is its like the cord is covered in shoe laces???? The cords is very susceptible to looking dirty as it collects lint.The scroll wheel has stopped functioning after 6 months. I have torn the mouse apart and killed my rgb. but i found out that i can probably fix it with super glue. GLAlso nice packaging for the price, comes with brand stickers. I had never seen this company before.Other wise nice and Cheap, has been working well for a month already.Its very very light.RGB is addressable through the downloadable software.Sensitivity settings are fully customizable, and easy to switch profiles (not that i care to switch it with a key on the mouse).For the price Id have done a 5 star if it didn't have the weird fabric sheath on the cord."}

I know there is a separate wireless charging port, but I think charging it with the materials it comes with should be much easier. The charging is designed poorly as it uses a tiny micro USB cable to connect to the mouse. This wouldn't be a problem. However, the way that the cable goes into the mouse makes it extremely difficult to pull it out of the mouse once it's done charging. It's hard to explain, but it's difficult to pull out because the cable is inserted into the front and center of the mouse. This means that to yank out the cable you would have to pull on the cable itself very hard and this may only damage it. Everything else about the mouse I love. My favorite feature is being able to adjust the tension on the scroll wheel. This is cool to me because I have never seen this feature in a mouse before. The batter life is decent. With daily use, I have to fully charge it every 3-5 weeks."}

It is small for me but can be perfect for others if you play in a certain gripping position, the center of my palm is higher than my actual wrist so it becomes uncomfortable as I'm using my wrist rather than my arm. It has plenty of programmable button, unless you're a MOBA player I'd look somewhere else. Overall it's a great gaming mice, but if you have large hands or play for extended amount of time.

It is now 2 years later and I've just bought a second one in addition to this purchase. My first mouse still works great with some minor hiccups (will detail below).In my current setup I now have 2 Baslisk Ultimate mice. The reason being: I now have two mice so when one needs to charge, I have the other sitting ready on the charger. And the best part is, the battery life isn't even a problem at all, it has some fantastic battery life. I go probably 2 weeks on a full charge. That being said, I specifically turned off the RGB lights to achieve this. The RGB lights do cut down on the battery life quite a bit, and I never look at my mouse and I really don't care to have RGB lights, I just really love this mouse (hence why I bought 2).As for the minor hiccups I mentioned earlier, there's really only been one. After some time, my mouse began to have some trouble charging on the dock. I found a forum post online talking about this and they recommended taking a Q-tip and dipping it in isopropyl alcohol and cleaning the charging contacts. I tried it, and it worked. I do have to clean it from time to time, but that is not a problem for me as I value the mouse very highly. I love this mouse because it is 1) wireless and 2) has a charging dock, so I don't have to fuss with plugging in a cable, I just set it down. I also love that 3) the dock can be set to turn specific colors indicating battery life.4) I am given the power of Hypershift which can be very powerful with a mouse. The way I primarily use it is: I set my Hypershift key to the trigger button on the mouse. Hypershift+left is bound to go back a page in my web browser, HS+right is forward a page, HS+left mouse wheel nudge moves me left a tab and HS+right mouse wheel moves me right a tab in the web browser. It makes web browsing such a fluid experience, no reaching for the tiny forward/backward button or wasting time moving your mouse there to begin with.Anyway I could go on and on with the ways this mouse is great. I haven't had any weird problems with it and it's lasted me 2 years and still going strong. I love it so much I bought a second one. I can't recommend it enough. And like I said, I haven't used other mice but there's literally no reason for me to look anywhere else. The only thing I can think of would be that I need to clean the charging dock, but that would probably be the case with anything that has wireless contacts. Heck, my Roomba has contacts that need cleaning (with the exact same method btw). I don't know if it's possible to design around that issue.Seriously I'm just trying to give praise to a product that is so perfect in my eyes it needs no further adjustments. Aside from Razer not selling the cable individually, in fact it doesn't even come with the dock if you buy it separately (BOOOOOO!!!!!) But if you have it plugged into the dock at all times, you'll never break it anyway. I recommend this mouse."}

I know there is a separate wireless charging port, but I think charging it with the materials it comes with should be much easier. The charging is designed poorly as it uses a tiny micro USB cable to connect to the mouse. This wouldn't be a problem. However, the way that the cable goes into the mouse makes it extremely difficult to pull it out of the mouse once it's done charging. It's hard to explain, but it's difficult to pull out because the cable is inserted into the front and center of the mouse. This means that to yank out the cable you would have to pull on the cable itself very hard and this may only damage it. Everything else about the mouse I love. My favorite feature is being able to adjust the tension on the scroll wheel. This is cool to me because I have never seen this feature in a mouse before. The batter life is decent. With daily use, I have to fully charge it every 3-5 weeks."}

The battery life is alright if you do light gaming but at times I've been playing for way longer and have had to grab the cable from the dock to charge it during matches. It is small for me but can be perfect for others if you play in a certain gripping position, the center of my palm is higher than my actual wrist so it becomes uncomfortable as I'm using my wrist rather than my arm. It has plenty of programmable button, unless you're a MOBA player I'd look somewhere else. Overall it's a great gaming mice, but if you have large hands or play for extended amount of time. I'd take those into consideration."}

It is now 2 years later and I've just bought a second one in addition to this purchase. My first mouse still works great with some minor hiccups (will detail below).In my current setup I now have 2 Baslisk Ultimate mice. The reason being: I now have two mice so when one needs to charge, I have the other sitting ready on the charger. And the best part is, the battery life isn't even a problem at all, it has some fantastic battery life. I go probably 2 weeks on a full charge. That being said, I specifically turned off the RGB lights to achieve this. The RGB lights do cut down on the battery life quite a bit, and I never look at my mouse and I really don't care to have RGB lights, I just really love this mouse (hence why I bought 2).As for the minor hiccups I mentioned earlier, there's really only been one. After some time, my mouse began to have some trouble charging on the dock. I found a forum post online talking about this and they recommended taking a Q-tip and dipping it in isopropyl alcohol and cleaning the charging contacts. I tried it, and it worked. I do have to clean it from time to time, but that is not a problem for me as I value the mouse very highly. I love this mouse because it is 1) wireless and 2) has a charging dock, so I don't have to fuss with plugging in a cable, I just set it down. I also love that 3) the dock can be set to turn specific colors indicating battery life.4) I am given the power of Hypershift which can be very powerful with a mouse. The way I primarily use it is: I set my Hypershift key to the trigger button on the mouse. Hypershift+left is bound to go back a page in my web browser, HS+right is forward a page, HS+left mouse wheel nudge moves me left a tab and HS+right mouse wheel moves me right a tab in the web browser. It makes web browsing such a fluid experience, no reaching for the tiny forward/backward button or wasting time moving your mouse there to begin with.Anyway I could go on and on with the ways this mouse is great. I haven't had any weird problems with it and it's lasted me 2 years and still going strong. I love it so much I bought a second one. I can't recommend it enough. And like I said, I haven't used other mice but there's literally no reason for me to look anywhere else. The only thing I can think of would be that I need to clean the charging dock, but that would probably be the case with anything that has wireless contacts. Heck, my Roomba has contacts that need cleaning (with the exact same method btw). I don't know if it's possible to design around that issue.Seriously I'm just trying to give praise to a product that is so perfect in my eyes it needs no further adjustments. Aside from Razer not selling the cable individually, in fact it doesn't even come with the dock if you buy it separately (BOOOOOO!!!!!) But if you have it plugged into the dock at all times, you'll never break it anyway. I recommend this mouse."}

Was there every 2-3 clicks and was a higher tone than the actual click so was really annoying. Plus the fact that I could hear it through my open back headphones made that particular mouse a somewhat bad experience. Also It would make the sound when just slightly wiggling the LMB and not actuating the switch.This was as of 04/16/20, should be getting the replacement on the 18th or 19th and I'll update once I've gotten some serious playtime in COD and BFV.PROS-  - Comfortable, Easy to set-up and Synaps was easy to use too.  - RGB set to 10% for the mouse seems to be peoples go-to for battery life/ visuals.  - QUALITY- Razer always has my respect for giving a high quality feel to their products. Even if their QC fails  them at times like mine.  - Charging dock comes with the sticky rubber base in order to keep it from moving around which is nice.  - Optional side mouse button is metal which is nice, and the switch for it is IMO the best feeling switch I've ever felt. Shame M4 and M5 dont feel like it.CONS-  - Can't use mouse.  - Would like to be able to have custom control over Color-to-Battery Life % on the dock.  - Charging dock gets much hotter than I would have expected, I'll probably drop the brightness on that as  well to see if that cools it down.  - Personal Bias, not a fault of the mouse, I come from using a Rival 300 for a few years, so I'm used to fat heavy mice. Even though its supposed to be about 18% lighter, I don't really feel it.  - Not a fan of the hard plastic they use for the pads, my Rival 300's pads glide much smoother over my new (2 months old) Corsair MM350 XL, the basilisk has a bunch of resistance almost like I can feel it getting caught on individual strands on the mouse mat.  - USB dongle feels very loose in the dock when inserted.  - As far as I could fine you can't set the additional side mouse button to be like a \"M6\" , it can be literally binded to any type of command imaginable. I could probably set it to flush my toilet, but it can't be its own standalone key."}

I managed to pick up the mouse and charging dock combo for under $100. First impressions were very good. It's well made, battery seems to get about 20-30ish hours of use before it needs a charge, although I leave it on the dock when it's not in use so it's never an issue. I wanted something a bit larger than average to fit my hands (I wear an XL glove, for reference), and the reviews that made this claim were right on - it's basically the perfect size.Buttons are well placed and feel sturdy, and I love the adjustable wheel resistance to get it just the way you want. This is my first mouse with a thumb rest and I'll never go back. There's plenty of sensitivity there. The only time I feel more than 20,000DPI would be needed is if you're playing on a 85\" 4K monitor at full res, or you're expecting way too much from a upper-mid-range gaming mouse. This one edged out the Logitech G502 for me because of the sale price I was able to get, and the option of the charging dock.My only gripes with the hardware are the power \"stubs\" on the charging dock (takes a few wiggles to get the mouse to sit on it properly), and the micro-USB charging port on the mouse itself (it's molded so it will only take a cable with a proprietary molded pigtail). These aren't huge issues, although if the cable were to ever break, you'd need to buy that specific cable and not just any micro-USB. The dock also uses the same cable, and you only get one in the box. Although if you're using the dock, you'll probably never need the cable directly into the mouse.My only real complaints that make the thing annoying to use, or where features are lacking, is the software side. As other reviews have said, it uses software called Razer Central to control the custom lights and other configuration options. The lighting UI is actually pretty decent and there are quite a number of customization options. There are some things lacking that I wish it had. For example, you can configure the mouse and dock to pulse from red to green as the mouse charges, to indicate battery life. It's a cool feature. But what I would LOVE is for the dock light to be able to show the current battery status of the mouse while it's in use. I do believe it turns yellow at 20% battery life, though.The biggest issue for me though is the constant updates that it does. I feel like at least once every week or so, I'll turn on my computer and everything lags for a minute or two while Razer Central does yet another update. Then a little later it'll just randomly turn all the lights off and on again, as if Roy Trenneman himself had instructed it.Although I should say that I later paired this mouse with a Razer Cynosa Chroma keyboard, so it's not like this problem stopped me from buying another Razer product. They really should work on their software, though. When it comes time to replace this mouse, if the software has improved by then, I'll consider Razer again."}
{"asin": "B08564NLZG", "username": "Ritvik N", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nA decent well-to-do mouse!", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020", "purchased": "Size: Mouse + Dock", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I bought this gaming mouse to replace my current cheap ergonomic mouse that I've had for a few years, as I'm slowly getting back into gaming again. How does it compare with my previous mouse? I wouldn't say that it completely blows it out of the water, but it definitely does do some damage. This is a lean beast of a mouse, built and made lean after decades of fighting in the gladiator pits. You can easily tell this mouse is corded and muscled, and well-trained for its true purpose. To be brandished as a masterful weapon, and bring glory and death to untold colorful pixels. Yeah, it's got a helluva job - you can't help but be envious of it.Sadly though, the ergonomic aspect has not seemed improved at all - or, at least, I don't notice a difference. Granted, the former was an ergonomic mice and it had kind of a wonky, \"unnatural\" design. But I can't honestly say that this is more ergonomic than the previous. It *is* slightly more noticeably sensitive and responsive to use  though. And it's got these cool buttons for all sort of control over it. Two dedicated macro keys for wrecking mayhem and finding the shortest path possible. But technically you can make it three, since the sensitivity clutch button wasn't overly useful to me (actually, I didn't really understand the point of it).Then there's the toggle buttons for adjusting the sensitivity. I default to using 1800 DPI. The other values are too fast for me. In fact I customized the sensitivity stages as I thought it was a little unrealistic (set the max as 4000 DPI on the last stage).The scroll wheel was a little hard for me with factory settings. I'd recommend adjusting the resistance wheel on the bottom to get the desired resistance from scrolling. Also, as I recently discovered, you can also *tilt* the scroll wheel if you're scrolling a lot, like say through an article online. Huh, that's nifty, I thought.Also, should mention that I bought this mouse over the Viper Ultimate. I would recommend you buy this over Viper if you're right-handed. It's ergonomic appeal would definitely tip the hat to it, I think.Charge: regarding battery life, me thinks it's ok. I just wish there was an easier way to check current battery health rather than going into the synapse app - maybe setting up a desktop notification when charge reaches <50% or so? I don't know, just spit-balling. There might be some settings for this somewhere, I'll have to have a look later. Right now, I would say the battery span is definitely not something I'm used to. I had a wireless ergonomic mouse previously, but that one was powered by two AA batteries, so I rarely needed to address any battery issues with that.Instructions for setting up mouse and charging dock:(Note, I thought i'd add this part here for reference, since originally I was a little confused myself as well. Hopefully this should help clarify things if anything was unclear, as the manual is not too useful)- Lift the tab from the underside of mouse to remove USB dongle, plug it into computer or into USB port on your keyboard if you have a pass-through port.- The included cable can also double as wired mode for the mouse, if you're low on battery, but it's unfortunate as that's also the one needed to connect the dock to power. Use the side labeled as 'TOP' facing north, and insert into dock or mouse. In case of mouse, attach other end to cable to PC; for dock, attach it to PC or any USB charging hub.-  It's easy to charge the mouse of the dock. Just place the mouse on the dock as you would on a rack - you can see the two holes on the underside of the mouse where the pins will fit into. The mouse should \"pulse\" colors green, orange, or red depending on the current battery level of the mouse.Overall, hope this helped. It's a great mouse, but I rated it down for the ergonomic and battery aspect of it. Still a solid contender for the leanest and meanest mouse, though."}

Unfortunately, because of buggy software and tracking issues, I had to return my purchase and change my review to 1 star.The mouse was smaller than I expected. For example, when I grab it, there's a 3 inch gap between the back of the mouse, and my palm. Unfortunately, nearly all mice are being made smaller these days. I'm guessing this is due to the average hand size found around the world.  It's too bad no one builds a \"big and tall\" version mouse and keyboard too.  Oh, and this is right hand mouse only (I'm right handed so no issue for me).  I did not rate my review score on size, because my hands are larger than most.The DPI is great, and almost too much for any real application. It's way more than what's needed, but really cool. I'm very impressed by the detail this mouse can crank out.The LED lights are pretty, colorful and the software has a lot of cool customizations. No complaints there.  What would be nice is the special purpose buttons had their own LEDs, which would make finding them easier.The battery life is very poor, especially if you run the lights. I turned off all the lighting features to save power. If you're into mouse disco lights, expect it to work for less than a day. Big difference to my other mouse (which had 1 led) that lasts 2 years on 2 AA batteries! While I understand higher DPI, fast response mice with lots of LEDs take more power, this should be matched with a much larger battery, perhaps 5x the watt hour rating.While the razer claims to have a focusing optical sensor, I found it no better than any other optical sensor mouse. It absolutely will not track on glass (something my laser mouse does just fine on), and despite it's high DPI, is not as accurate as a laser mouse with lower DPI.  Something to consider when buying a higher end mouse.  Finding laser mice these days is difficult, because I think all the mice makers went to the lower cost optical sensors. Too bad, laser mice rock.It's not a Bluetooth mouse. It would be nice if it included this feature. Installing a dongle isn't always practical. Also, no bluetooth means the mouse is useless on mobile devices, such as a tablet computer.The Razer software is buggy, bloated, has UI issues, and requires you to sign in every time you reboot the software or computer. Seriously? do you really want to sign into your mouse software? That is crazy.  If you wish to use very basic functions, such as scroll left / right with scroll wheel, you'll need this software running (unfortunately). Is it spyware? I don't know, and I don't care. If someone wants to spy on my stupid video games, go for it. (hey, I broadcast them anyway). The software was crashing on my Window 10 PC several times a day, requiring going to the task manager, and \"end task\", then restarting the software.  While the mouse will work after the software has crashed, many of the basic features won't (such as the left/right scroll).  Sorry, unstable software affecting basic functionality on a mouse is a deal breaker. Bloatware and needing to \"sign in\" is nearly a deal breaker too.The buttons aren't too bad, but not the best. The special purpose buttons are all in awkward locations, especially the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel. All the buttons feel like a cheap commodity mouse, no precision and very \"clicky\". The scroll wheel could use some improvements, it's just too clunky, doesn't free spin unless you loosen the tensioner on the bottom, then spins too free. The wheel isn't nice, isn't fast, and is a junk. I do like the left/right scroll feature on the mouse wheel. Unfortunately, the Razer software must be running for that feature to work, and the software is unstable.The mouse tracks well, until it doesn't!  This too is a major deal breaker, and in fact after the mouse froze  more than a dozen times a day, typically for 3 to 10 seconds each, I stopped using it. Tracking issues with or without Razer's software, with or without the wired USB, and on multiple mouse pads I tried. Not reliable enough for even doing office work, and you could forget using it for games. Yes, the mouse was close to the wireless receiver at about 1 foot (300 mm). No, there was no other interfering devices. In fact I've never had wireless device issues on this computer in this room before.  I'm guessing the mouse freezing is due to buggy mouse firmware, or a marginal optical sensor (or both).  I've used 5 dollar optical mice that perform fine without tacking issues. Sorry, it was a no brainer as to if I should keep the high priced mouse or return it.  In fact even if I couldn't return it, I would still have never used it.  A mouse that freezes is unacceptable.The cable it shipped with is excellent, and allows recharge and use while connected. This cord is very flexible, and probably the best USB wire cord material I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, as I wrote, even when wired, the mouse still had tracking issues. There is also a design problem with the cable connector in the mouse because of the very narrow channel to reach the mouse USB connector. What kind of design is that? So, for all practical purposes the (nice) cable is proprietary. I consider this a problem, because the mouse needs recharging every few hours, meaning you'll always need that cable if you take the mouse elsewhere.  If you lose the cable, good luck charging your mouse.I'm so sorry, but I can't recommend this mouse. Beyond being unreliable, it's small, cheap feeling, not easy to charge on a standard USB cable and with it's very short battery life, it is just too expensive for what it is.  I went back to my old logitech mouse I bought 5 years ago. Those that have already bought a Razer, and can't return it, I recommend gifting it to a child. The size is perfect them, they'll love the pretty lights, and they won't know the difference when the mouse stops tracking..."}

Ever since, I've been a huge Logitech fanboy. But when the G502 Lightspeed was announced, I was intrigued. Yet, I found the idea of having a cable nearby at all times in order to charge the mouse unintuitive. Additionally, having to plug in the cable would be a hassle. If I truly wanted to go wireless, I would need a $100 mousepad which would charge my mouse wirelessly. Yet, with an extended mousepad, the additional mousepad seemed incommodious since I owuld have had to layer the two. With the mousepad, the total price would have been $250. All for the luxary of going wireless.So when I heard about the Basilisk Ultimate HyperSpeed by Razer, I became interested. I've always had a grudge with Razer mice in the past since the ones I did have were uncomfortable and broke easily (but to be fair, they were cheap and I didn't put utmost care into them.) However, after watching reviews online and looking more into the mouse, I decided to buy it. I have never regret that decision.Transitioning from the G502 to the Basilisk Hyperspeed was a breeze, since they both have a similar form-factor. The features that are included with this mouse are amazing. The charging dock is stylish enough to blend in with the rest of my setup, and only takes up one USB port since the wireless receiver for the mouse can be plugged in to the port directly on the dock, which is already plugged in to your PC. The feet of the mouse are 100% PTFE, meaning that they will glide with ease and will not hold you back when gaming. The scroll sensitivity adjustment located on the bottom of the mouse is also really nice, since you can adjust it to have a very pronounced tactile bump on each step when scrolling or a buttery smooth scroll with no bump whatsoever, and anywhere in between of course. Additionally, as soon as you plug the dock in to your PC, a message will pop up prompting you to download Razer Synapse, so there's no need to go looking online for software.Within Razer Synapse, there are many cool features you can take advantage of. The sensors on the bottom can be fine tuned to detect the liftoff distance between the mouse and the surface it is facing to your liking, both distancing from and towards the surface independently. The lighting on the mouse is also fantastic when using Chroma Studio built in to Synapse, which can let you control each of the 14 LED's individually, or be used in sync with various lighting effects. And don't worry about the lights draining your battery, since you are given the option to have the mouse turn off all lighting after a certain amount of time of idling with no input.The battery life on the mouse is nothing to scoff at. I typically only fully charge my mouse about once every week and a half, and I use my PC for about 6-10 hours daily. Also, this mouse charges quick, and a few minutes of charge and get you nearly an hour of use.There's a lot more to this mouse than meets the eye, and I know I didn't cover everything that this mouse can do. But, despite it's features, this mouse is extremely pricey. But if you're willing to spend a hefty price for a top tier mouse, then I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}

Also It would make the sound when just slightly wiggling the LMB and not actuating the switch.This was as of 04/16/20, should be getting the replacement on the 18th or 19th and I'll update once I've gotten some serious playtime in COD and BFV.PROS-  - Comfortable, Easy to set-up and Synaps was easy to use too.  - RGB set to 10% for the mouse seems to be peoples go-to for battery life/ visuals.  - QUALITY- Razer always has my respect for giving a high quality feel to their products. Even if their QC fails  them at times like mine.  - Charging dock comes with the sticky rubber base in order to keep it from moving around which is nice.  - Optional side mouse button is metal which is nice, and the switch for it is IMO the best feeling switch I've ever felt. Shame M4 and M5 dont feel like it.CONS-  - Can't use mouse.  - Would like to be able to have custom control over Color-to-Battery Life % on the dock.  - Charging dock gets much hotter than I would have expected, I'll probably drop the brightness on that as  well to see if that cools it down.  - Personal Bias, not a fault of the mouse, I come from using a Rival 300 for a few years, so I'm used to fat heavy mice. Even though its supposed to be about 18% lighter, I don't really feel it.  - Not a fan of the hard plastic they use for the pads, my Rival 300's pads glide much smoother over my new (2 months old) Corsair MM350 XL, the basilisk has a bunch of resistance almost like I can feel it getting caught on individual strands on the mouse mat.  - USB dongle feels very loose in the dock when inserted.  - As far as I could fine you can't set the additional side mouse button to be like a \"M6\" , it can be literally binded to any type of command imaginable. I could probably set it to flush my toilet, but it can't be its own standalone key."}

I managed to pick up the mouse and charging dock combo for under $100. First impressions were very good. It's well made, battery seems to get about 20-30ish hours of use before it needs a charge, although I leave it on the dock when it's not in use so it's never an issue. I wanted something a bit larger than average to fit my hands (I wear an XL glove, for reference), and the reviews that made this claim were right on - it's basically the perfect size.Buttons are well placed and feel sturdy, and I love the adjustable wheel resistance to get it just the way you want. This is my first mouse with a thumb rest and I'll never go back. There's plenty of sensitivity there. The only time I feel more than 20,000DPI would be needed is if you're playing on a 85\" 4K monitor at full res, or you're expecting way too much from a upper-mid-range gaming mouse. This one edged out the Logitech G502 for me because of the sale price I was able to get, and the option of the charging dock.My only gripes with the hardware are the power \"stubs\" on the charging dock (takes a few wiggles to get the mouse to sit on it properly), and the micro-USB charging port on the mouse itself (it's molded so it will only take a cable with a proprietary molded pigtail). These aren't huge issues, although if the cable were to ever break, you'd need to buy that specific cable and not just any micro-USB. The dock also uses the same cable, and you only get one in the box. Although if you're using the dock, you'll probably never need the cable directly into the mouse.My only real complaints that make the thing annoying to use, or where features are lacking, is the software side. As other reviews have said, it uses software called Razer Central to control the custom lights and other configuration options. The lighting UI is actually pretty decent and there are quite a number of customization options. There are some things lacking that I wish it had. For example, you can configure the mouse and dock to pulse from red to green as the mouse charges, to indicate battery life. It's a cool feature. But what I would LOVE is for the dock light to be able to show the current battery status of the mouse while it's in use. I do believe it turns yellow at 20% battery life, though.The biggest issue for me though is the constant updates that it does. I feel like at least once every week or so, I'll turn on my computer and everything lags for a minute or two while Razer Central does yet another update. Then a little later it'll just randomly turn all the lights off and on again, as if Roy Trenneman himself had instructed it.Although I should say that I later paired this mouse with a Razer Cynosa Chroma keyboard, so it's not like this problem stopped me from buying another Razer product. They really should work on their software, though. When it comes time to replace this mouse, if the software has improved by then, I'll consider Razer again."}
{"asin": "B08564NLZG", "username": "Ritvik N", "title": "4.0 out of 5 stars\nA decent well-to-do mouse!", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020", "purchased": "Size: Mouse + Dock", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I bought this gaming mouse to replace my current cheap ergonomic mouse that I've had for a few years, as I'm slowly getting back into gaming again. How does it compare with my previous mouse? I wouldn't say that it completely blows it out of the water, but it definitely does do some damage. This is a lean beast of a mouse, built and made lean after decades of fighting in the gladiator pits. You can easily tell this mouse is corded and muscled, and well-trained for its true purpose. To be brandished as a masterful weapon, and bring glory and death to untold colorful pixels. Yeah, it's got a helluva job - you can't help but be envious of it.Sadly though, the ergonomic aspect has not seemed improved at all - or, at least, I don't notice a difference. Granted, the former was an ergonomic mice and it had kind of a wonky, \"unnatural\" design. But I can't honestly say that this is more ergonomic than the previous. It *is* slightly more noticeably sensitive and responsive to use  though. And it's got these cool buttons for all sort of control over it. Two dedicated macro keys for wrecking mayhem and finding the shortest path possible. But technically you can make it three, since the sensitivity clutch button wasn't overly useful to me (actually, I didn't really understand the point of it).Then there's the toggle buttons for adjusting the sensitivity. I default to using 1800 DPI. The other values are too fast for me. In fact I customized the sensitivity stages as I thought it was a little unrealistic (set the max as 4000 DPI on the last stage).The scroll wheel was a little hard for me with factory settings. I'd recommend adjusting the resistance wheel on the bottom to get the desired resistance from scrolling. Also, as I recently discovered, you can also *tilt* the scroll wheel if you're scrolling a lot, like say through an article online. Huh, that's nifty, I thought.Also, should mention that I bought this mouse over the Viper Ultimate. I would recommend you buy this over Viper if you're right-handed. It's ergonomic appeal would definitely tip the hat to it, I think.Charge: regarding battery life, me thinks it's ok. I just wish there was an easier way to check current battery health rather than going into the synapse app - maybe setting up a desktop notification when charge reaches <50% or so? I don't know, just spit-balling. There might be some settings for this somewhere, I'll have to have a look later. Right now, I would say the battery span is definitely not something I'm used to. I had a wireless ergonomic mouse previously, but that one was powered by two AA batteries, so I rarely needed to address any battery issues with that.Instructions for setting up mouse and charging dock:(Note, I thought i'd add this part here for reference, since originally I was a little confused myself as well. Hopefully this should help clarify things if anything was unclear, as the manual is not too useful)- Lift the tab from the underside of mouse to remove USB dongle, plug it into computer or into USB port on your keyboard if you have a pass-through port.- The included cable can also double as wired mode for the mouse, if you're low on battery, but it's unfortunate as that's also the one needed to connect the dock to power. Use the side labeled as 'TOP' facing north, and insert into dock or mouse. In case of mouse, attach other end to cable to PC; for dock, attach it to PC or any USB charging hub.-  It's easy to charge the mouse of the dock. Just place the mouse on the dock as you would on a rack - you can see the two holes on the underside of the mouse where the pins will fit into. The mouse should \"pulse\" colors green, orange, or red depending on the current battery level of the mouse.Overall, hope this helped. It's a great mouse, but I rated it down for the ergonomic and battery aspect of it. Still a solid contender for the leanest and meanest mouse, though."}

Unfortunately, because of buggy software and tracking issues, I had to return my purchase and change my review to 1 star.The mouse was smaller than I expected. For example, when I grab it, there's a 3 inch gap between the back of the mouse, and my palm. Unfortunately, nearly all mice are being made smaller these days. I'm guessing this is due to the average hand size found around the world.  It's too bad no one builds a \"big and tall\" version mouse and keyboard too.  Oh, and this is right hand mouse only (I'm right handed so no issue for me).  I did not rate my review score on size, because my hands are larger than most.The DPI is great, and almost too much for any real application. It's way more than what's needed, but really cool. I'm very impressed by the detail this mouse can crank out.The LED lights are pretty, colorful and the software has a lot of cool customizations. No complaints there.  What would be nice is the special purpose buttons had their own LEDs, which would make finding them easier.The battery life is very poor, especially if you run the lights. I turned off all the lighting features to save power. If you're into mouse disco lights, expect it to work for less than a day. Big difference to my other mouse (which had 1 led) that lasts 2 years on 2 AA batteries! While I understand higher DPI, fast response mice with lots of LEDs take more power, this should be matched with a much larger battery, perhaps 5x the watt hour rating.While the razer claims to have a focusing optical sensor, I found it no better than any other optical sensor mouse. It absolutely will not track on glass (something my laser mouse does just fine on), and despite it's high DPI, is not as accurate as a laser mouse with lower DPI.  Something to consider when buying a higher end mouse.  Finding laser mice these days is difficult, because I think all the mice makers went to the lower cost optical sensors. Too bad, laser mice rock.It's not a Bluetooth mouse. It would be nice if it included this feature. Installing a dongle isn't always practical. Also, no bluetooth means the mouse is useless on mobile devices, such as a tablet computer.The Razer software is buggy, bloated, has UI issues, and requires you to sign in every time you reboot the software or computer. Seriously? do you really want to sign into your mouse software? That is crazy.  If you wish to use very basic functions, such as scroll left / right with scroll wheel, you'll need this software running (unfortunately). Is it spyware? I don't know, and I don't care. If someone wants to spy on my stupid video games, go for it. (hey, I broadcast them anyway). The software was crashing on my Window 10 PC several times a day, requiring going to the task manager, and \"end task\", then restarting the software.  While the mouse will work after the software has crashed, many of the basic features won't (such as the left/right scroll).  Sorry, unstable software affecting basic functionality on a mouse is a deal breaker. Bloatware and needing to \"sign in\" is nearly a deal breaker too.The buttons aren't too bad, but not the best. The special purpose buttons are all in awkward locations, especially the 2 buttons behind the scroll wheel. All the buttons feel like a cheap commodity mouse, no precision and very \"clicky\". The scroll wheel could use some improvements, it's just too clunky, doesn't free spin unless you loosen the tensioner on the bottom, then spins too free. The wheel isn't nice, isn't fast, and is a junk. I do like the left/right scroll feature on the mouse wheel. Unfortunately, the Razer software must be running for that feature to work, and the software is unstable.The mouse tracks well, until it doesn't!  This too is a major deal breaker, and in fact after the mouse froze  more than a dozen times a day, typically for 3 to 10 seconds each, I stopped using it. Tracking issues with or without Razer's software, with or without the wired USB, and on multiple mouse pads I tried. Not reliable enough for even doing office work, and you could forget using it for games. Yes, the mouse was close to the wireless receiver at about 1 foot (300 mm). No, there was no other interfering devices. In fact I've never had wireless device issues on this computer in this room before.  I'm guessing the mouse freezing is due to buggy mouse firmware, or a marginal optical sensor (or both).  I've used 5 dollar optical mice that perform fine without tacking issues. Sorry, it was a no brainer as to if I should keep the high priced mouse or return it.  In fact even if I couldn't return it, I would still have never used it.  A mouse that freezes is unacceptable.The cable it shipped with is excellent, and allows recharge and use while connected. This cord is very flexible, and probably the best USB wire cord material I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, as I wrote, even when wired, the mouse still had tracking issues. There is also a design problem with the cable connector in the mouse because of the very narrow channel to reach the mouse USB connector. What kind of design is that? So, for all practical purposes the (nice) cable is proprietary. I consider this a problem, because the mouse needs recharging every few hours, meaning you'll always need that cable if you take the mouse elsewhere.  If you lose the cable, good luck charging your mouse.I'm so sorry, but I can't recommend this mouse. Beyond being unreliable, it's small, cheap feeling, not easy to charge on a standard USB cable and with it's very short battery life, it is just too expensive for what it is.  I went back to my old logitech mouse I bought 5 years ago. Those that have already bought a Razer, and can't return it, I recommend gifting it to a child. The size is perfect them, they'll love the pretty lights, and they won't know the difference when the mouse stops tracking..."}

Ever since, I've been a huge Logitech fanboy. But when the G502 Lightspeed was announced, I was intrigued. Yet, I found the idea of having a cable nearby at all times in order to charge the mouse unintuitive. Additionally, having to plug in the cable would be a hassle. If I truly wanted to go wireless, I would need a $100 mousepad which would charge my mouse wirelessly. Yet, with an extended mousepad, the additional mousepad seemed incommodious since I owuld have had to layer the two. With the mousepad, the total price would have been $250. All for the luxary of going wireless.So when I heard about the Basilisk Ultimate HyperSpeed by Razer, I became interested. I've always had a grudge with Razer mice in the past since the ones I did have were uncomfortable and broke easily (but to be fair, they were cheap and I didn't put utmost care into them.) However, after watching reviews online and looking more into the mouse, I decided to buy it. I have never regret that decision.Transitioning from the G502 to the Basilisk Hyperspeed was a breeze, since they both have a similar form-factor. The features that are included with this mouse are amazing. The charging dock is stylish enough to blend in with the rest of my setup, and only takes up one USB port since the wireless receiver for the mouse can be plugged in to the port directly on the dock, which is already plugged in to your PC. The feet of the mouse are 100% PTFE, meaning that they will glide with ease and will not hold you back when gaming. The scroll sensitivity adjustment located on the bottom of the mouse is also really nice, since you can adjust it to have a very pronounced tactile bump on each step when scrolling or a buttery smooth scroll with no bump whatsoever, and anywhere in between of course. Additionally, as soon as you plug the dock in to your PC, a message will pop up prompting you to download Razer Synapse, so there's no need to go looking online for software.Within Razer Synapse, there are many cool features you can take advantage of. The sensors on the bottom can be fine tuned to detect the liftoff distance between the mouse and the surface it is facing to your liking, both distancing from and towards the surface independently. The lighting on the mouse is also fantastic when using Chroma Studio built in to Synapse, which can let you control each of the 14 LED's individually, or be used in sync with various lighting effects. And don't worry about the lights draining your battery, since you are given the option to have the mouse turn off all lighting after a certain amount of time of idling with no input.The battery life on the mouse is nothing to scoff at. I typically only fully charge my mouse about once every week and a half, and I use my PC for about 6-10 hours daily. Also, this mouse charges quick, and a few minutes of charge and get you nearly an hour of use.There's a lot more to this mouse than meets the eye, and I know I didn't cover everything that this mouse can do. But, despite it's features, this mouse is extremely pricey. But if you're willing to spend a hefty price for a top tier mouse, then I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}

Great mouse skates besides that. Installed easily, and smooth."}

{"asin": "B09X6PP4XX", "username": "Mitchell hegnes", "title": "2.0 out of 5 stars\nDon't buy these unless you like immense wrist and arm pain.", "loc_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2022", "purchased": "Color: Magenta", "rating": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "content": "I was told about these and figured I'd give them a shot. They look really cool and application was a breeze. Initially I knew there'd be an adjustment period but not even an hour in and my wrist and arm were in pretty intense pain. They have absolutely zero stopping power and can just slide itself across the mat while you're on the other side of the room. They're constantly twitchy and if you use FPS settings like having aim smoothing off, changes with DPI, etc they're almost impossible to even double click with. I still after over a week haven't adjusted to the twitchy nature of these things. They also will do a surprising amount of damage to your mousepad relatively quickly. I'm noticing things on my glorious after a week. Cool theory, awful result."}
